            <div property='schema:abstract' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
              <p>This thesis is about research communication in the context of the Web. I analyse literature which reveals how researchers are making use of Web technologies for knowledge dissemination, as well as how individuals are disempowered by the centralisation of certain systems, such as academic publishing platforms and social media. I share my findings on the feasibility of a decentralised and interoperable information space where researchers can control their identifiers whilst fulfilling the core functions of scientific communication: registration, awareness, certification, and archiving.</p>

              <p>The contemporary research communication paradigm operates under a diverse set of sociotechnical constraints, which influence how units of research information and personal data are created and exchanged. Economic forces and non-interoperable system designs mean that researcher identifiers and research contributions are largely shaped and controlled by third-party entities; participation requires the use of proprietary systems.</p>

              <p>From a technical standpoint, this thesis takes a deep look at semantic structure of research artifacts, and how they can be stored, linked and shared in a way that is controlled by individual researchers, or delegated to trusted parties. Further, I find that the ecosystem was lacking a technical Web standard able to fulfill the awareness function of research communication. Thus, I contribute a new communication protocol, <cite><a href='#linked-data-notifications'>Linked Data Notifications</a></cite> (published as a W3C Recommendation) which enables decentralised notifications on the Web, and provide implementations pertinent to the academic publishing use case. So far we have seen decentralised notifications applied in research dissemination or collaboration scenarios, as well as for archival activities and scientific experiments.</p>

              <p>Another core contribution of this work is a Web standards-based implementation of a clientside tool, <cite><a href='#decentralised-linked-research-application'>dokieli</a></cite>, for decentralised article publishing, annotations and social interactions. dokieli can be used to fulfill the scholarly functions of registration, awareness, certification, and archiving, all in a decentralised manner, returning control of research contributions and discourse to individual researchers.</p>

              <p>The overarching conclusion of the thesis is that Web technologies can be used to create a fully functioning ecosystem for research communication. Using the framework of Web architecture, and loosely coupling the four functions, an accessible and inclusive ecosystem can be realised whereby users are able to use and switch between interoperable applications without interfering with existing data.</p>

              <p>Technical solutions alone do not suffice of course, so this thesis also takes into account the need for a change in the traditional mode of thinking amongst scholars, and presents the <cite><a href='#linked-research'>Linked Research</a></cite> initiative as an ongoing effort toward researcher autonomy in a social system, and universal access to human- and machine-readable information. Outcomes of this outreach work so far include an increase in the number of individuals self-hosting their research artifacts, workshops publishing accessible proceedings on the Web, in-the-wild experiments with open and public peer-review, and semantic graphs of contributions to conference proceedings and journals (the Linked Open Research Cloud).</p>

              <p>Some of the future challenges include: addressing the social implications of decentralised Web publishing, as well as the design of ethically grounded interoperable mechanisms; cultivating privacy aware information spaces; personal or community-controlled on-demand archiving services; and further design of decentralised applications that are aware of the core functions of scientific communication.</p>

                  <p id='alternative-way-of-change'>Well, that is what this thesis is going to be all about. It is about modern research communication, and just because it is there, shapes the way we think and behave; and why it exists in the form it does, and who or what was responsible for it to exist at all. What is an alternative way of change?</p>

                  <p id='sociotechnical-transformations'>The idiosyncratic relationships between technological breakthroughs and societal transformations throughout history are intrinsically intertwined. It was not until I came across <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connections_%28TV_series%29' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709103110/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connections_%28TV_series%29' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:31:10Z'>Connections</a></cite>, the TV series by James Burke that I had a glimpse of the phenomenon about the increasingly interlinked human endeavours over time. After encountering Marshall McLuhan\u2019s theories on communication and how media have the power to shape and transform human nature, what to do next was mostly clear (in my head). Given these realisations or perspectives as a foundation, being a Web technologist only enabled me to build the necessary connections between what was previously missing or underdeveloped. The rest was mostly a matter of struggling with the ghost in the machine and working alongside our shared social challenges.</p>

                  <p id='web-as-an-extension'>Ironically, even today, academics essentially operate within a paper-centric framework to create and disseminate publicly-funded knowledge by usually delegating it to third-party publishers which still operate in the 15th century. Meanwhile, the Web \u2013 if we can anthropomorphise for a moment \u2013 is disappointed by the distracted academics\u2019 practices. I took the liberty to test the boundaries and demonstrate some of the aspects of what the native affordances of the Web provided \u2013 an extension of our central nervous system.</p>

                  <p id='information-society'>I live in an <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_society' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190729074950/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_society' data-versiondate='2019-07-29T07:49:50Z'>information society</a></cite>, which makes use of variety of communication media to meet societal needs. The Web has shaped social policies and practices around the world, as well as influence the creation and use of other technologies. It has also reconfigured individuals to be active participants in global information exchange, as well as passive consumers partly due to the abundance of instantaneously available multimedia. To date \u2013 30 years old as of this writing \u2013 the Web is considered to be a net positive for society all meanwhile open and complex challenges remain. Like any human technology, what we devise and how we use them has societal implications.</p>

                  <p id='the-story'>We can start this story from anywhere. I argue that in order to best contextualise this thesis, it is essential to operate under the understanding of communication mediums and scientific revolutions, as well as their effects on society. This is especially because the research goals of this thesis at its core is <em>sociotechnical</em>, and that a clear division between them will not do its justice. I believe that in order to push the boundaries of our knowledge further, it necessitates a multidisciplinary undertaking \u2013 taken <q cite='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_of_salt'>with a grain of salt</q>. One overarching goal is to foster the social machinery from different perspectives that is required to build a knowledge Web for any type of user; human, machine, or other. While I set the problem context to scholarly communication, applications of the knowledge and generated artifacts are potentially applicable to other initiatives in society.</p>

                  <p id='assumptions'>I assume that researchers in scholarly communication are motivated to some extent personally, whether that is with the goal to take part in advancing collective knowledge, society and life, career advancement, prestige, or financial gain. Researchers are intrinsically interested in making their impact by way of sharing their findings in a manner that is most accessible to potential users. As for the underlying technical machinery for information exchange, I assume that it is useful to aim in designing interoperable information systems to help us address problems in context of societal goals. All of these aspects are part of the <q cite='http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/729965164'>social machine</q> of scholarly communication, and are explored through the sections.</p>

                  <p id='up-next'>As many have argued, for scholarly communication to be more effective; accessible, usable, inclusive, as well as equitable, we need to adopt methods that are better at identifying and making use of the native affordances of the Web. This is particularly important today since academic and social activities use the Web as the primary medium to communicate (in contrast to systems that mimic paper media). Hence, I examine the core characteristics of the Web, discuss the state of affairs in scholarly communication, and share my findings on how a way to fulfill the forces and functions in scientific communication can be met by a socially-aware decentralised client application along with an ocean of open Web standards at its disposal.</p>

                      <p>In research projects, there are various stakeholders (in)directly acting as internal and external forces in scholarly communication. In order to address societal concerns, research sponsors fund projects to attain reusable technical designs and acquire new knowledge in the process. Knowledge workers like researchers and scholars are driven by curiosity to advance our understanding of the universe and share their findings. The public is interested in accessing applications of research to educate and for the well-being of life.

                      <p id='interoperability-autonomy-problems'>There are several sociotechnical limitations in the contemporary paradigm that the scholarly communication operates in. I will summarise a subset of problem areas pertaining to interoperability of systems and autonomy of actors. Each problem space will be reviewed in relevant sections of this thesis.</p>

                      <p id='restricted-access'>There is an abundance of scientific information on the Web. However, humans and machines have restricted access, are required to pay, or hindered to efficiently discover, make sense of, and create new connections between information.</p>

Actors \u2013 creators and readers \u2013 in these systems often do not have the means to switch between applications and share data between them.</p>

                      <p id='lack-of-diverse-value-chains'>There is a lack of diverse value chains for different units of scholarly communication due to tightly coupled proprietary systems. The actors in these systems create and exchange information by (being forced into) using packaged systems and workflows, give up their rights, and not have control over how their creations can be disseminated and reused.</p>

                      <p id='web-affordances-neglected'>The actors in the system commonly use print-centric tools and data representations to exchange content on the Web and neglect to take advantage of the available affordances of the Web (media). Actors\u2019 possibility to shape their contributions in Web media is typically constrained to third-party service provider\u2019s centralised and non-interoperable solutions.</p>

                      <p id='identifier-data-privacy'>Actors\u2019 use of personal and professional identifiers, as well as data storage from third-parties are subject to privacy issues. Actors typically manage multiple disconnected profiles, social connections, and data spaces.</p>

                      <p>We need to understand the various technological mediums in which scholarly communication has historically operated, and how and why this has changed, in order to have a frame of reference for new work. Our investigation must examine scholarship with respect to the media employed for publication, dissemination and feedback, and identify some of the constraints and limitations. This research can serve to describe the effects and artifacts of scholarly communication, as well as conceptual and technical designs that are used to exchange units of information by both humans and machines.</p>

                      <p>The scholarly communication ecosystem is a complex sociotechnical system, which cannot be understood from either a social or a technical perspective alone. Understanding how these aspects feed into and influence on another is crucial for the furtherance of this work.</p>

                      <p>The five review characteristics; focus, goal, perspective, coverage, and audience, are borrowed from the summary at <cite><a rel='cito:usesMethodIn' href='https://pareonline.net/pdf/v14n13.pdf' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20181027145946/https://pareonline.net/pdf/v14n13.pdf' data-versiondate='2018-10-27T14:59:46Z'>Practical Assessment, Research &amp; Evaluation</a></cite>, Randolph, 2009, which is based on <cite>Organizing knowledge syntheses: A taxonomy of literature reviews</cite>, Cooper, 1988.</p>

                      <p id='focus-characteristic'><strong>Focus</strong>: The core focus of the reviews and cited material was to establish a connection between the available theories and their underlying mechanisms, as well as the application of certain interventions to help identify and apply a practical need. Hence, majority of the analysis and synthesis focuses on practices or applications in the field.</p>

                      <p id='goal-characteristic'><strong>Goal</strong>: My intention is to present this thesis in a way that is technically and meaningfully connected with the knowledge out there, as well as to connect my contributions. Hence, I would like any reader (human, machine, or other) in the future to be able to observe and verify the connections that I have put together as much as possible. The main interest for the reviews and citations were information integration for the big picture, identification and discussion of central issues, and explicating arguments.</p>

                      <p id='perspective-characteristic'><strong>Perspective</strong>: As this thesis is about connecting and endorsing open scholarly knowledge in context of decentralised and social Web, there is a selection bias in favour of (research) information based on the following criteria:</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Publicly accessible URL in the case of digital objects.</li>
                        <li>Referencable URI in the case of printed material.</li>
                        <li>Article and data including full text and media.</li>
                        <li>Accessible by anyone (humans and machines).</li>
                        <li>Available to anyone without financial, legal, or technical barriers (besides an Internet connection, free of charge).</li>
                        <li>Preference for source materials (as opposed to third-party re-publications).</li>
                        <li>Preference for research artifacts that can be publicly archived and recalled with free on-demand services.</li>
                        <li>Preference for research artifacts made available with declarative languages (as opposed to dynamically generated as part of an application).</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>At the time of this writing, HTTP URIs of research objects resolving to <q>paywall</q> or <q>access toll</q> landing pages were excluded. The rationale is that if information is <em>only</em> available to a subset of humans, then it is not deemed to be part of the observable and reproducible universal knowledge \u2013 a fundamental requirement of applying the scientific method. Fortunately, I was able to gather plenty of open and free <em>resources</em> to support the narrative of this thesis, and addressing its knowledge goals.</p>

                      <p id='coverage-characteristic'><strong>Coverage</strong>: The reviewed and cited works are composed of a purposive sample, examining only pivotal works and the source of concepts in the field to tie them together. While this selection is naturally not exhaustive in and itself, I have considered, located, and discussed material that was available at the time of my investigation. While there may be natural imperfections in data collection, evaluation, analysis, and interpretation in any literature review and bibliographic citations, I have aimed to be systematic in what\u2019s covered. To that end, the works \u2013 text, data, media, or other \u2013 mentioned in this thesis were included or excluded based on the following criteria:</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Information in English.</li>
                        <li>Web accessible digital objects.</li>
                        <li>Printed material available through a public library loan.</li>
                        <li>Referencing information that is legally made available to the public (to the best of my knowledge!)</li>
                      </ul>

This massive reversal has, for one of its consequences, elitism. The nature of the mass production of uniform volumes certainly did not foster elites but rather habits of universal reading. Paradoxically, when there are many readers, the author can wield great private power, whereas small reading elites may exert large corporate power.</p>

                      <p id='acoustic-age'><strong>Acoustic age</strong>: According to McLuhan, the acoustic world depended on speech and hearing for communication. Information was an instantaneous and simultaneous experience for speakers and listeners with a collective identity. Existence was about narrated events and survived through story-telling, songs, and poems.</p>

                      <p id='writing-age'><strong>Writing age</strong>: When the phonetic alphabet came along, information could be defined, classified, and referenced, as well as better preserved. The written word made human knowledge tangible, stretching itself across time and space. While the written word increased the need of our visual system, it brought along the acoustic world with it \u2013 early reading was still an oral, and by and large an external (social) activity, as opposed to internal in one\u2019s mind.</p>

                      <p id='print-age'><strong>Print age</strong>: Through the age of writing to the age of print, the phonetic alphabet transformed from being an audile-tactile experience to purely visual. Gutenberg\u2019s printing press (c. 1439 CE), through the process of mechanical mass production, had an extensive impact on the circulation of information, and triggered reconfiguration of societies\u2019 structures. Books have boundaries, uniformity, continuity, linearity, and repeatability; this had a profound influence on the organisation of social systems. Print further <q>detribalised</q> social organisations, enabling individualism, fragmentation, government centralism, and nationalism. As a work was mechanically copied, it maintained its consistency and accuracy in comparison to hand copied manuscripts. It was easier to transmit information without personal contact. Then came the responsibility for authors to be consistent with their definitive statements.

Print media democratised knowledge as soon as it became a commodity, mass produced and distributed to populations. The general public had a reason to not only access or acquire media like books, but also had a reason to learn to read for themselves, where previously it was necessary to go through a third-party; the wealthy, scholar, or theologian, in order to be informed. The increase in literacy consequently helped the public to be better knowledgeable about world matters without being subject to official or unofficial censorship. As there were more readers, the ability to write fostered the formulation and preservation of individual thought and culture, as well as enabling the public to voice themselves and question authority.

                      <p id='electronic-age'><strong>Electronic age</strong>: The electric <em>mass</em>-age made it possible to have instantaneous communication in different forms across the globe. Electronic media did not have the same kinds of boundaries that the print had on society and so society was able to re-organise itself differently. Unlike print media, electronic media like telephone, radio, and television, did not require literacy, and consequently the support of a stable education system. As a whole, it had the same effects on society as the acoustic space created in the tribal world. The speed of information increased, and with it recovered sociality and involvement which was previously abandoned as the primary mode of information exchange. Perhaps more interestingly, as the flow of information through various electronic media accelerated, it facilitated our natural tendency to recognise patterns and (ir)regularities in data \u2013 in comparison to print media which happened to isolate, classify, and immobilise items in fixed space.</p>

                      <p>Later I will revisit McLuhan\u2019s studies on the psychic and social consequences of technological innovation and apply them to scholarly communication on the Web.</p>

Kuhn contended that science did not progress linearly through history, rather it starts with a period that\u2019s disorganised, and then a paradigm \u2013 a collection of <em>exemplar</em> agreed by scientists on how problems are to be understood \u2013 develops to organise things for day-to-day <q>normal science</q> to take place under the governed paradigm. After some time, <q>anomalies</q> in the paradigm accumulate and lead to a <q>crisis</q> phase where multiple competing paradigms attempt to resolve the issues. This is a particular point in which the community struggles to come to an agreement on the fittest way to practise future science. Finally a <q>paradigm shift</q> \u2013 revolution \u2013 refers to the last phase where transforming ideas and assertions mature enough to bring order to earlier anomalies, and cause a change in world view.</p>

                      <p id='fruitful-science'>Kuhn reasoned that progress in science was not a mere line leading to truth, but the notion of moving away from less adequate concepts of and interactions with the world in favour of more <em>fruitful</em>. As to which paradigm can be objectively determined to be better, Kuhn argued that scientists\u2019 decision was ultimately inter-subjective and required value judgement because paradigms \u2013 the ideas and assertions within \u2013 were not necessarily directly comparable. For example, early versions of the heliocentric model proposed by Copernicus in <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentariolus' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709103110/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentariolus' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:31:10Z'>Commentariolus</a></cite> (1514), as well as the matured version in <cite xml:lang='la' lang='la'><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_revolutionibus_orbium_coelestium' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709103110/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_revolutionibus_orbium_coelestium' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:31:10Z'>De revolutionibus orbium coelestium</a></cite> (1543) was neither quantitatively or qualitatively more accurate than Ptolemy\u2019s <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_model' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709103111/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_model' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:31:11Z'>geocentric model</a></cite> (c. 2nd century CE) based on the knowledge and instruments available at the time. While they were equally internally consistent, geocentrism was regarded to be more consistent with the other accepted theories and doctrines in comparison. Copernicus\u2019 case however offered a simpler explanation and broader scope of application which ultimately was preferred. These were attractive characteristics for Kepler and Galileo when they came to investigate. With Newton\u2019s laws for motion and gravitation, the heliocentric model matured enough to set a new course for science and research.</p>

                      <p>Another example demonstrating the complexity of choosing a theory was from the perspective of language and communication. For instance, the term "mass" has radically different meanings in Newton\u2019s theory of gravity and Einstein\u2019s relativity theory because the definitions are isolated to their respective paradigms. However, General Relativity gave a new lens to understanding the interaction of mass in space-time. While the definition for mass changed, Einstein\u2019s theory was still able to precisely predict Newton\u2019s theory, and further provided an explanation for how gravity worked.</p>

                      <p>Contemporary scholarly communication is situated within a particular paradigm.

Content follows form; mediums and paradigms shape the space.</p>

                      <p>As the characteristics of the spoken word carried over to writing, and writing to print, print media also influenced electronic media like the Web and hypermedia.

For example, authoring tools help us to design and create electronic documents that resemble print representations even if they are not intended to be printed.

The project started with the philosophy that much academic information should
be freely available to anyone. It aims to allow information sharing within

                          <p>The Web architecture permits agents to communicate through different protocols eg. HTTP, FTP, SMTP are application layer protocols in the <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105642/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:42Z'>Internet Protocol Suite</a></cite> (<abbr title='Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Application and Support'>RFC 1123</abbr>). In this thesis, the focus is on HTTP for data communication, ie. the structured requests and responses exchanged by Web agents. For example, when a <em>user-agent</em> (like a Web browser) initiates a request to access the contents of a resource identified by an HTTP URI (<em>dereferencing</em>), a server responds with a message body including a representation of the resource state, and data about the response. The content of the response URL (HTTP URI) is a particular state in that it has a presentation and controls (affordances) that can be further engaged with, eg. hyperlinks to follow; data forms that can be submitted; location of alternate representations. One particular description of this interaction is given in 2000 by Fielding, in <cite><a rel='cito:obtainsBackgroundFrom' href='http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105643/https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:43Z'>Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a></cite>, commonly referred to as <cite>Representational State Transfer</cite> (<abbr title='Representational State Transfer'>REST</abbr>): a set of architectural constraints for distributed hypermedia systems.

                          <p id='safe-interactions'>There are two categories of interactions: safe and unsafe. A <dfn>safe interaction</dfn> is one where the requested resource\u2019s state does not change. When an agent makes a retrieval request (<code>HTTP GET</code>), it has no obligation beyond dereferencing the URL. An <dfn>unsafe interaction</dfn> on the other hand may cause a resource to change its state, and that the user may be held accountable, depending on the semantics of the interaction. For example, an agent sending an <code>HTTP POST</code> request with a payload can get a response indicating that a new resource was created, that the resource represented by the URI was deleted by an <code>HTTP DELETE</code> request, or that the agent is unauthorised to either create or delete the resource.</p>

                          <p id='representations'>When a client requests a resource, the server may return a <em>particular</em> representation of a resource that is the result of a "negotiation" between them. For example, a client may indicate that it would accept the resource in HTML, Turtle, and JSON-LD data formats, and in English and Armenian languages. The server could provide a response body using HTML and English.</p>

The extension mechanisms eg. in HTML and CSS, allowed new semantics or features to be declared in the content that can be processed by conforming Web agents. Web agents get to choose whether to ignore unrecognised content or try to understand and treat unrecognised patterns as errors. When a browser encounters a syntactical error in an XHTML document, it can stop processing the document or display an error to the user, also known as draconian error-handling. An HTML document on the other hand has a more forgiving error-handling model. An unrecognised component or non well-formed structure would not prevent processing and no alert needed to be passed to the user interface. To date, HTML acts as a unifying language for human interfaces to information systems.</p>

                      <p id='rdf-unifying-language'>Conceptually, RDF was in the fabric of the Web from the start. By <em>naming</em> things with URIs, we can construct structured sentences with RDF. By comparison, HTML at its core is a terse approach to representing and linking knowledge. RDF on the other hand is intended to be a unifying language for machine interfaces to data systems. I will further discuss language mixing with RDF in HTML and XML-family languages via <cite><a href='#rdfa'>RDFa</a></cite>.</p>

                      <p id='aaa'>One conceptual view of the Web is that <q cite='https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/RDFnot#ER'>anyone being (technically) allowed to say anything about anything</q> (<abbr title='Anyone can say Anything about Anything'>AAA</abbr>). One consequence of AAA is that while systems (and reasoners within) can operate under both the <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world_assumption' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105644/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world_assumption' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:44Z'>open-world assumption</a></cite> (<abbr title='Open-world Assumption'>OWA</abbr>) or the <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-world_assumption' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105644/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-world_assumption' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:44Z'>closed-world assumption</a></cite> (<abbr title='Closed-world Assumption'>CWA</abbr>), the Web ultimately uses the OWA framework because new knowledge can always make its way into the system, and lack of knowledge does not imply falsity. RDF applies a particular restriction of the AAA principle in that nonsensical, inconsistent, or conflicting information can be created or inferred. It is up to processing applications to determine their confidence on the information. Hence, an important distinction: assertions made using the RDF language are claims, as opposed to facts.</p>

                      <p>In the same vein, furthering the study of <em>Web Science</em> itself can be done through advancements in how we communicate scholarly findings; through better enabling universal access and connections within our collective knowledge.</p>

Bruce states that under the dialectical view, the Web\u2019s multimodal features allows new values and ways of making meaning as an holistic involvement for the consumer. This view is a useful exemplification of McLuhan\u2019s notions on the effects of media on society.</p>

While Eisenstein\u2019s account of the history is not regarded as doctrine, the work demonstrates that the printing press, as a technological innovation, was a potent force in the evolution of social systems, as well as a communication technology which intensified the evolutionary process in the storage and dissemination of information and data.

                      <p id='print-shifting-communication'>Eisenstein postulates that the printed book played a central role in the <q>rapid dissemination of knowledge to whole new classes that created the modern new attitudes to both science and religion at the end of the fifteenth century.</q> The mere availability of prior knowledge to the public, stimulated scientific curiosity further, and eventually gave birth to the scientific revolution, p. 691. Eisenstein also contends that the communication shift in technical literature occurred even before astronomers changed their views about the structure of the universe, p. 685. Moreover, the origins of the scientific revolution was partly due to the rediscovery of classical scientific texts, and the effects of an internal strife between academic innovators and conservationists (<q>quarrels of learned men</q>), trying to control the field of knowledge outside of academia, p. 523-524, 570. Eisenstein emphasises on the <q>relevance of external social institutions to the internal, relatively autonomous, life of science</q>, p. 636, as well as the utilitarian <q>application of the mathematics to the problems of the natural world</q>, p. 683.</p>

                      <p>In order to open up access to scholarly journal literature, BOAI recommends the adoption of two complementary strategies for open access (<abbr title='Open Access'>OA</abbr>):</p>

                        <li>Self-Archiving</li>

For OA-centric scientific literature, quality-control and certification are integral.</p>

                      <p id='oa-models-costs'>The foundations of the OA approach were conceived at a time when the major revenue models to cover publishing costs for scholarly literature were through subsidies from institutions, journal subscriptions, or pay-per-view. In this payment model, consumers of the literature were charged either individually or through institutions. In contrast, the <cite>article processing charge</cite> (<abbr title='Article Processing Charge'>APC</abbr>) model requires publication costs to be covered upfront, thereby waiving the costs for the consumers of the literature. Today, APC is the most widely used method to finance OA publishing, with varying levels of fees.

                      </ol>

                      <p>The role of the journal includes both <q>main</q> (editorial, quality control, recognition of work, marketing, and disseminating) and <q>hidden</q> (subject and community defining, and archiving) functions. The proposed <em>deconstructed journal</em> model is preferable to the <q>paper</q> influenced electronic publishing model in that both main and hidden roles can be accomplished in a distributed manner. Here, Smith emphasises allowing greater academic freedom and shifting of power and control from the monolithic third-parties to the knowledge producers, which could be realised in either an <em>institution-</em> or <em>researcher-centric</em> approach. In this process, journals with the refereeing process would link to the articles with full content hosted on the authors\u2019 Web sites. To get there, however, Smith acknowledges that for such a new paradigm to be adopted, professional and funding bodies must transition themselves to accepting the decoupling and self-controlled literature publishing model as something equivalent (in terms of academic value) to the traditional model.</p>

                      <p id='grey-literature'>After two decades, the anecdotal evidence suggests that academia acknowledges the sort of equivalence that Smith describes at varying levels. For example, while literature quality-control can be generally anywhere on the Web, on the other hand, self-published literature remains to be treated as <q>grey literature</q>, that is, any material that is outside of the traditional scholarly distribution channels, especially when it comes to academic reward systems.</p>

The article echoes earlier work in that the scholarly journals bundle multiple functions, and that this tight coupling has hindered innovation, is inefficient, and makes it difficult to improve individual functions. The article also states that the current system, ie. the bundling of the closed publishing and certification models, is unlikely to change if the communication functions are not decoupled, regardless of all the other out-of-band activities \u2013 activism or innovation \u2013 to improve the publishing models or certification mechanisms.

The authors echo many of the ideas of Smith with respect to decoupling and decentralisation, however they only go as far as describing them within the context of scholarly functions operating alongside institutional or third-party online services. While the article does not exclude the possibility of units of information being self-hosted and individually-controlled by the researchers, it is not explored further.

                      <p>One of the shortcomings of the research publication system is that scientific literature in electronic formats resemble, mimic, and have similar affordances to printed papers. While the paper-centric approach has been adequate, although not necessary optimal, for human consumption and reuse, it is insufficient for machine-assisted analysis or reuse. The print-centric affordances lack structure that could enable better aggregation, discovery, processing, and integration \u2013 which machines excel at \u2013 and in turn help with human-led tasks. Representing and storing semantically structured knowledge on the Web enables automated agents to process information more intelligently.</p>

Are they citing something because it supports their perspective, or because they disagree with it?

Authors may be unable to obtain or generate a precise identifier, or lack an authoring or referencing environment which would allow them to assign identifiers appropriately. When an author\u2019s intentions are preserved only in prose, entity-recognition techniques are typically required to understand the original intentions of citations.

Depending on the one or more roles an actor has in the creation, editing, and republishing of content, the decision to create a new or reusing identifier is left as a judgement call.</p>

                      <p>Here I discuss a few systems that pertain to registration of identifiers:</p>

In order to have a resource assigned with a DOI, it has to be done by one of the DOI registration agencies which requires organisational membership, excluding individuals. For example, a typical journal publisher as a member of a DOI registration agency (eg. <cite><a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://www.crossref.org/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190618081912/https://www.crossref.org/' data-versiondate='2019-06-18T08:19:12Z'>CrossRef</a></cite>) submits mappings for objects of interest. Given the statement in AWWW, <q><a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#URI-persistence'>URI persistence is a matter of policy and commitment on the part of the URI owner</a></q>, DOI introduces an additional layer of social contract to govern the discovery of research artifacts. A DOI is aimed at being a persistent identifier for an object it is assigned to, and has the mechanism to refer to the URL of an object where it can be found. That is, a DOI may refer to a landing page about the actual object and not necessarily the object itself \u2013 this happens to be a common practice for literature that is not necessarily open and free. For literature that has restricted access, the resolved DOI is typically a webpage where an actor would need to go through the system\u2019s <q>paywall</q> or <q>access toll</q> in order to retrieve the content. From a machine\u2019s perspective, what the DOI identifies at the resolved location is not clear eg. company logo, tracking software, search form or the intended research object? For open literature, the resolved DOI would generally hyperlink to the actual scientific object in human-interpretable only fashion, or be part of a webpage accompanied by material unrelated to the scientific object itself, ie. information that the scientists neither assembled as part of their research nor intended for the consumer. If the actual URL of the object changes, the DOI\u2019s lookup table for the URL has to be updated. Otherwise, they'll point to dead links or unrelated information.</p>

An ORCID identifier is specified as a URI. While anyone can create and update their ORCID profile, the identifier is ultimately owned and managed by the ORCID organisation and made available through <code>orcid.org</code>. Profiles are constrained to express to the UI\u2019s template and the kind of information ORCID is willing to store. For most intents and purpose, the free service offered by ORCID is sufficient for researchers, and provides a mechanism where researchers can aggregate information about their education, employment, funding, and works like academic publications and data. It also allows researchers to extend their profile descriptions, as well as linking to their alternative online profiles.</p>

For digital objects accessible over the Internet, PIDs are intended to be used as a long-lasting reference to a unit of information, and be <em>actionable</em> in the sense that the environment can be directed to the identified source. For example, a DOI-based PID can be <samp>10.2218/ijdc.v9i1.320</samp>, and the organisation \u2013 in this case the International DOI Foundation \u2013 would be responsible to maintain an unambiguous mapping to an accessible resource. Typically once mapped, the process starts from a DOI URI <samp>https://doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v9i1.320</samp> which (currently) resolves to the location <samp>http://www.ijdc.net/article/view/9.1.331</samp> where its contents can be retrieved.

                  <p id='scholarly-ecosystem-effects'>The scholarly ecosystem is inherently social. Researchers and scholars have been exchanging and collaborating on their findings and questioning, just as they were in the era of the <cite>Republic of Letters</cite>. The social dimension not only exerts a force within the research community, from the society, and eventually flowing back out to society. As the Web deeply impacts societies, in addition to using social media, researchers and academics have also been studying sociotechnical systems from their respective disciplines. We need to understand the effects of the tools we use on the ecosystem and on scientific and scholarly communication. There is a top-down social pressure for research openness and access to knowledge that is in the public interest, however, achieving it through the methods and ethics is challenging for societies. In this section, I will overview how researchers use social media, quality control and certification, and access to research knowledge in context of privilege and gatekeeping.</p>

                      <p>Contemporary social media and networking sites has been facilitating academics to exchange information. More specifically, academics use social media for a variety of reasons, to name a few: to network and collaborate; disseminate and find research results, crowd-source and crowd-fund research challenges, engage with public and foster trust on research results by providing authoritative feedback.</p>

                      <p id='online-scholarly-communities'>There are online communities geared towards scientists, academics, librarians, and scholars with topical focus on various aspects of scholarly communication.

Academics from different disciplines communicate to publish and review articles in different states (pre-prints to post-prints), pose and answer questions, construct identities and build profiles, exchange messages, as well as explore trends.</p>

                      <p id='online-social-media'>Online social media tools are affecting or influencing scholarly communication from a variety of fronts. For instance, with the advent of the Web and the notion academics having the right and means to exchange scholarly literature with their peers for free, there has been plethora of initiatives and developments over the course of three decades in academia, libraries, archives, as well as standards for creating, sharing and preserving (<cite><a rel='cito:citesAsDataSource' href='http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Main_Page' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190224140551/http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Main_Page' data-versiondate='2019-02-24T14:05:51Z'>Open Access Directory</a></cite>). Moreover, the call to take advantage of features offered by the new media, has opened new ways of publishing and disseminating scientific and scholarly knowledge globally, as well as institutional infrastructures being adapted to meet communication needs. For example, universities providing an online space for staff members and students to publish their profiles, as well as to share their research interests, academic output, and other educational material. Institutional repositories have been built to retain copies of scholarly work, as well as mechanisms to exchange data with other repositories.</p>

                      <p id='citizen-science'>In recent years, there has also been growing number of community-led initiatives for individuals to help researchers and scientists by performing <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709111133/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T11:11:33Z'>citizen science</a></cite> independently, from sharing photos of coral reefs, analysing radio signals, to solving protein structures.</p>

As the medium revolutionised interactive publications, it was possible for peer review to be supplemented with online commentary as another form of quality control for scholarly literature at any state.</p>

                      <p id='function-of-peer-review'>The scientific community has been aware of the crude and fallibility of traditional peer review, for example, in cases such as, crediting bad research, good research getting dismissed for political reasons, <q>predatory publishing</q> (quality of the research content being irrelevant), or even treating commentary or opinion pieces as equivalent to scientific evaluation. <em>Nevertheless</em>, the function of peer review in the scholarly system is a form of self-regulation and certification. Without having any maintenance for quality, distinguishing valid, reliable, useful and ethical work from those not, would be difficult to achieve systematically. This is particularly concerning where the general public can become aware of a piece of information, yet the validity of the research findings may be inaccessible or absent, and thus have major consequences to our society and the planet \u2013 as with cases where widely agreed scientific evidence and observable effects of global climate change can be easily "questioned" by propaganda spread through mass-media by elite forces with a personal or private agenda; the amplification of the flat Earth conspiracy, and so on.</p>

                      <p id='reproducible-replicable'>Reproducible research findings refers to the notion that when the exact methods are used to replicate or repeat to reach the same findings. However, for some research, reproduction is not always possible, for example when data is sensitive, or influenced by time or space. In this case, replication can be carried out to answer the same research questions using similar or equivalent approaches. The reproduction of the original work can be either confirmatory, ie. able to reproduce, or; contradictory, unable to reproduce or inconclusive. Thus, in order to reconstruct how the data was generated and to make sense of it, data needs to be accompanied by enough detail about its provisional interpretations.</p>

                      <p>The scholarly communication system has been the subject of controversies internationally ever since the shift towards its systematisation and the effect of the forces in society, research market and knowledge industry. Controlling access to information or knowledge in all intents and purposes has been a race to controlling science (communication), financial and political power. Moreover, intelligence gleaned from users data has not only been profitable, but has also raised long-standing privacy issues.</p>

                      <p id='effects-of-third-parties-on-scholarly-communication'>Some of the observable effects of commercial participants in the scholarly ecosystem on scholarly communication is that they have the means to monitor the usage and interaction of units of scholarly information, censor who or what information gets shared and at what cost, have the agency to control the flow of information, and influence the coupling of their notion of academic impact to a biased incentive system.</p>

                      <p id='open-with-a-fine-print'>The current state of scholarly communication predominantly operates under the notion of requiring or relying on third-party publishers to make scholarly contributions available, as well as setting technical and ethical constraints on what can potentially be a scholarly contribution. Looking at this from another perspective, we can observe that actor-controlled participation is not possible towards \u201copen\u201d participation. I will highlight <em>some</em> of the technical practices (from a plethora of instances) put in place by third-party publishers (irrespective of genuine interest in adhering to the Open Science initiative) which raises a number of user experience (<abbr title='User Experience'>UX</abbr>) issues.

                  <p>The actor and content forces are generic and internal to the scholarly market, and are considered to be indispensable in that there would not be a scientific communication market if there are no researchers and the artifacts they exchange. The accessibility and applicability forces on the other hand are external forces because they shape, give purpose to, or influence the activities and content.</p>

                  <p>The registration and archiving are objective functions in that they are external to the research process. Information exchange cannot take place if there are no usable identifiers for the units of communication or if no knowledge preservation measures are put in place. Certification and awareness are subjective communication functions \u2013 internal to the research process. Registration and awareness are different aspects of making information findable, or <em>scientific observations</em>. Certification and archiving are aspects of <em>scientific judgement</em>, ie. they act as filtering mechanisms in the information space.</p>

In particular, the communication is becoming more <q>Web-centric</q> ie. visible, continuous, informal, instant, content-driven, and the communicated objects vary in their type, have compound composition, diverse, networked, and open.</p>

                  <p>Given that the emergence of the Web influenced the communication market by transforming it from predominantly being medium-driven into a content-driven ecosystem, as well as the research process becoming more visible on the Web (per the <q>Open Science</q> movement), the article also posit that the aforementioned indicators impact the functions in scientific communication, and in particular have a significant impact on the future of archiving. The observation is based on the archival process held on the Web; unplanned and unconstrained archiving, organically occurring, by way of Web objects being deposited across distributed and dedicated archival services. They describe the effect of Web-based archiving with respect to the four functions:</p>

                  <ul id='web-archiving-forces-functions'>
                    <li>registration: a wide variety and versions of objects that are compound, dynamic, interrelated, and interdependent are available from different Web platforms;</li>
                    <li>certification: a variety of mechanisms that are decoupled from registration;</li>
                    <li>awareness: a variety of objects being communicated in real-time and social;</li>
                    <li>archiving: <q>no constraints on the number or kinds of parties that can hold archived copies</q>, the need for <q>appropriate levels of cross-archive interoperability in order to support seamless, uniform access to archived objects</q>, that are temporally appropriate while context being preserved</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>The authors conclude that in order to address the needs of a distributed archival approach for scholarly Web objects, standards will play a central role for interoperable systems.</p>

                  <p id='rethinking-distributed-archived-scholarly-communication'>Given the dynamic nature of units of communication on the Web, vertical integration, stepping through the four functions in order (as per the traditional journal-centric ecosystem), turns out to be inadequate. Hence, an affirmation of the outlook as outlined in <cite>Rethinking Scholarly Communication</cite>, that the essential functions need to be <q cite='https://hvdsomp.info/papers/Papers/2014/iPres2014_Sompel_Treloar.pdf'>fulfilled in discreet, disaggregated, and distributed manners, and in which a variety of networked pathways interconnect the autonomous hubs that fulfill these functions</q>. The act of <q>recording</q> (or <em>registering</em> in the most general sense) a unit of communication is not a replacement for <em>archiving</em> or persistence, even if the freely available Web services are used towards this end. The authors distinguish recording and archiving in that the former is short-term, no guarantees provided, used for many read-write operations, and part of a scholarly process. Archiving serves a different function, in that it is intended for the long-term, and there is an attempt of a guarantee (or promise) and the archived artifact becomes part of the scholarly record.</p>

                  <p id='web-archivable-scholarly-communication'>The authors call for another archival paradigm that is based off the characteristics of the Web. That is, given the inherently interlinked and dynamic nature of Web objects, archived resources cannot be treated as atomic resources as they do not necessarily contain the complete content. For instance, a research document on the Web may refer to external media or interactive scripts, aggregated objects, and changing or ephemeral objects. This is in contrast to the traditional journal-centric approach to archival where all material \u2013 physical paper \u2013 can be eventually tracked to library stacks. Hence, the future of archiving needs to consider the nature of the object, including the degree to which it can be archived.

                  <p>In recent decades there has been a global shift in communication forms used for scientific activities. This perhaps demonstrates a desire for amplification of the senses that are used to consume and create knowledge. For instance, print-centric emphasises the linearity of scientific information representation and its communication, whereas a Web-centric approach makes multimodal interactions possible within the same domain. Scientists need no longer fit their understanding of the world within the confines of static and two-dimensional descriptions of phenomena. The need to travel great distances for first-hand observations and collaboration is also reduced. With electronic media, and more specifically the Web, we have the option to also watch, listen, and participate around measured observations, instantaneously as the events occur, or after the fact around persistent and detailed logs. Just as the invention of the printing press transformed the codification and mobility of knowledge, the Web transformed and extended human and machine communication on all fronts. What will be further explored in this thesis is the extent to which our current scholarly activities make use of the inherent qualities of the Web, as well as ways to further take advantage of these qualities.</p>

While McLuhan\u2019s critique was about the effect of the print media in the electric age, it stands especially valid today in the age of interactive new media. For instance, the <em class='cool-media'>World Wide Web</em> is a <q>cool media</q> because its access, multi-linearity, and interactive possibilities offer multi-sensory states for individuals. This is in contrast to <em class='hot-media'>print</em>, considered by McLuhan to be <q>hot media</q>, demanding primarily the attention of our vision. As the printed word\u2019s requirement for the other senses is minimal, it <em>spoon-feeds</em> the content to the reader in a l-i-n-e-a-r <span class='typographic-wave'><span>f</span><span>a</span><span>s</span><span>h</span><span>i</span><span>o</span><span>n</span></span>. The literate or print culture is passive and is detached from immediate involvement because the medium has no such requirements. The cooler media on the other hand, requires a greater level of engagement from the audience at a faster rate. This increased engagement allows us to detect change and better recognise patterns, which, according to <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_grouping' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190729074952/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_grouping' data-versiondate='2019-07-29T07:49:52Z'>Gestalt laws of grouping</a></cite>, makes the whole of the information easier to follow and understand.</p>

                  <p id='what-constitutes-scholarly-contribution'>The interaction of media with our senses is an inherent property of media. The media\u2019s built-in sensory bias affects and transforms human society and psyche. Modern media, like the Web, offer extensible interactions, creative participation, and social engagement. There is a natural human desire to connect and exchange ideas, behaviour, or style with others, as well as to co-create. Given these opportunities, the fundamental question to ask here is, why should research communication be limited to, evaluated by, and rewarded on methods and practices be based on print-centric media? Scholarly communication still uses methods which date back to the invention of the <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190729074952/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press' data-versiondate='2019-07-29T07:49:52Z'>mechanical movable type printing press</a></cite> (c. 1450 CE), even in the advent of the globally accessible and interactive new media that are at our fingertips today, and at much faster turnaround times from publication to consumption than ever before. The practices correspond to publication workflows that are in place for academic communication, and have remained largely unchanged for over a century. What does it mean to have an academic achievement through a \u201cpublication\u201d? If we consider the Web as a potential supplement to or replacement for these older practices, and given that the Web can be purposed for greater possibilities than print alone, then we (members of the academic community) also need to address the question, <em>what constitutes a scholarly contribution?</em></p>

                  <p id='print-centric-hot-media'>Today, it is evident that the typical academic publishing scenario requires adherence to the <em>printability</em> aspects of the information eg. <span class='unicode-document'>page length, typographical guidelines</span>. That is, all of the encompassing data or supporting artifacts for any given research output typically must be channelled through the characteristics of print media. In practice, this leads the research community to use tools that are tailored solely for printing or viewing (on screen). This (sticking to print) leads to unnecessary information loss or arbitrary filtering of the content, which might be otherwise preserved if a different medium was used. Since print is only one possible way to represent and communicate the information, it is worthwhile to investigate and employ alternative or complimentary representations that are more appropriate given the affordances of the Web. Traditional electronic document formats, on the hot end of the media spectrum, are trying remain relevant inside a cool medium.</p>

While the document-centric Web was mostly for human-readability, Linked Data-based Web is oriented towards improving discoverability, readability, and reuse for machines, and in effect better helping humans. For example, if research articles capture their <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/web-science-from-404-to-200#problem-space'>problem statements</a>, <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/call-for-linked-research#no-central-authority'>motivation</a>, <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/sense-of-lsd-analysis#hypothesis-null'>hypothesis</a>, <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/cooling-down-web-science#introduction'>arguments</a>, <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/enabling-accessible-knowledge#workflow'>workflow steps</a>, <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/sense-of-lsd-analysis#methodology'>methodology</a>, <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#protocol'>design</a>, <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-statistical-data-analysis#results'>results</a>, <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#analysis-and-evaluation'>evaluation</a>, <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-research-scholarly-communication#conclusions'>conclusions</a>, <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/dokieli#next-steps'>future challenges</a>, as well as all <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://dokie.li/#figure-dokieli-citation'>inline semantic citations</a> (to name <em>a few</em>) where they are uniquely identified, related to other data, and discoverable, then specialised software can be used to verify the article\u2019s well-formedness with respect to the domain.

                  <p>In this section I examine some of the existing Web standards and practices for the structure and semantics of scholarly information with focus on narrative documents and observational data. Scholarly documents with the characteristics of a continuous prose, such as those of research articles typically includes factual information about an investigation with supporting provenance-level information and references to underlying data. Annotations in the general sense can be similar to articles, however they are generally intended to encapsulate an indirection where target resources are associated with annotation activities with motivations, eg. commenting, bookmarking, or classifying. Notifications for scholarly activities serve as a way to inform a target of interest about events in general.

A typical scholarly article may include a sequence of sections, usually an abstract; introduction and background relevant to earlier work; methods used to justify experiments; research results; discussion and conclusions; and a list of references. Different forms of research eg. original, scientific, artistic, or research in the humanities, may have their own discipline-centric organisational structures for the journal article. For example, <em>Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion</em> (<abbr title='Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion'>IMRAD</abbr>) is a widely adopted standardised structure in original research articles as per survey, <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC442179/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190729124632/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC442179/' data-versiondate='2019-07-29T12:46:32Z'>The introduction, methods, results, and discussion (IMRAD) structure: a fifty-year survey</a></cite>, Sollaci, 2004.

The imperative programming style on the other hand is about <em>how</em> the program should execute and change the program state. The declarative approach tends to be short, easy to understand, independent of implementation, less likely to contain errors as well as to easily correct, and tractable. For example, many domain-specific markup languages, such as HTML and XML-family (XSLT, SVG, MathML), and CSS are declarative. HTML simply tells the consuming agent \u2013 like a Web browser \u2013 what should appear as part of a Webpage.

While this is sufficient to cover various use cases in a scholarly information space, it is limited in the sense that the granularity of machine-readable content is based on the classic hypertext model, ie. ultimately a relationship with loose semantics between documents or their parts. It is considered to be limited in terms of capturing domain-specific knowledge. This is in contrast to using RDF as the language to communicate knowledge about arbitrary things at different levels of abstraction. Atomic statements about scientific information and scholarly activities can be expressed, as well as each component of a statement being universally identifiable. The language enables the information to be serialised using different syntaxes eg. HTML+RDFa, Turtle. Perhaps most importantly, the underlying data is intended to be manipulated as a <em>graph</em> of things, where its syntactical representations remaining isomorphic across serialisations.</span></p>

Here HTML merely acts as the container to encapsulate the underlying information and to offer presentations and interactions (in regardless of the RDF syntax embedded in HTML). RDFa specifies only a syntax and allows independently defined specifications (like vocabularies) to be used. RDFa defines a single, non-domain-specific syntax, used alongside a hosting language\u2019s syntax, so that fragments of information can be consistently interpretable.

Hovering a link with the cursor can trigger the Web browser to display the full target URL in the status bar of the application, and hence informing the user on what lies ahead before engaging further. If the user is already familiar with the link (visited earlier) or uninterested, they can skip. The interaction with the hypertext is in essence non-linear, ie. we can follow the links as far as we are able to, or interested, and then come back to where we started. Similarly, machines, like Web-crawlers are able to perform exactly the same process. Moreover, hyperlinks marked up with specific relations to their target reference can signal information that can effectively induce unique interactions. In that respect, RDFa in HTML for instance can help enrich and enable the structure for different interaction possibilities, for example though runtime JavaScript or the Web browser\u2019s built-in understanding of the underlying actions.

As for better accessibility, incorporating WCAG where applicable can help user-agents, including text-only Web browsers, Web crawlers, and other agents with minimal capabilities to parse and render content. With respect to traditional Web documents, the information that is visible, observable, or human-readable from HTML is considered to set the lowest barrier to obtain content.

Authors refer to the notion of <q>deferred representations</q> where the final state of a resource is when all code and events have finished executing. Hence, representations rely on JavaScript to fully render do not serve well for archival crawlers that are unequipped to handle JavaScript. On the other hand, certain archival services include a feature known as <em>headless browser</em> that is capable of processing the resource similar to common GUI-based Web browsers with JavaScript enabled, and thus capturing the final state of the representation once all scripts are executed. This too however may be problematic for content that dynamically changes based on the instructions of the script.

RASH aims at sharing scholarly documents through the Web while working within the existing publishing workflow, and is expected to be produced from MS Word, ODT and LaTeX sources. RASH has been developed as a formal grammar using RelaxNG which includes a subset of elements \u2013 32 \u2013 from HTML5. With the exception of the <code>script</code> element, it is compiled of printable elements. Its grammar facilitates RASH documents to run against a markup validator, to convert between sources, rendering for Web and print media, and to extract additional semantics. Its rationale for representing human-visible and machine-readable information in HTML varies eg. title, authors, keywords of an article are used as hidden metadata, and require additional processing to make it human-visible in the Web browser, as such a dependency on JavaScript support and being enabled. The resulting grammar favours simplicity towards authoring over expressing accurate or appropriate semantics eg. <code>h1</code> for all heading levels is used, as opposed to HTML5\u2019s required heaving levels (<samp>hX</samp>). The format allows DPUB-ARIA and RDFa annotations, as well as embedding JSON-LD, Turtle, and RDF/XML data islands with the <code>script</code> element.</p>

It applies the notion of <q>semantic overlays</q> for its markup patterns with focus on role-based semantics as defined in WAI-ARIA, DPUB-ARIA, and semantic representations using RDFa. The \u2013 work-in-progress \u2013 specification explains how concepts for people and organisation, article semantics, schema roles, actions, citations, document rights, and so forth can be marked using appropriate vocabularies, using the schema.org vocabulary as base. In order to simplify authoring, where applicable, it is encouraged to use RDFa markup patterns where the depth (level of nesting in the DOM tree) for the RDF statements would be relatively flat. One consequences of this rule of thumb may be that there can be duplicate information or parts of the information being human-visible whereas some others would be intended only for machine use.</p>

It has a highly structured mechanism to represent statistical observations, classifications, and data structures. Given that SDMX is arguably the most widely used standard for statistical data exchange (among statistical agencies and others), a great amount of statistical data about our societies is yet to be discoverable and identifiable through the Open Web Platform.

                      <p>In <cite><a rel='cito:usesConclusionsFrom' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-statistical-data-analysis' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212225/https://csarven.ca/linked-statistical-data-analysis' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:25Z'>Linked Statistical Data Analysis</a></cite>, Capadisli, 2013, puts forward an approach based on decentralised (and federated) structured queries to retrieve statistical data from various SPARQL endpoints, conducting various data analyses (eg. regression analysis), and providing the results of the analysis as Linked Data back to the user. The system demonstrating the mechanism stores the analysis in RDF to enable future discovery and reuse eg. researchers looking up statistically significant results based on a set of indicators for a specific reference area. As a result, distributed linked statistics with accompanying provenance data can be more easily explored and analysed by interested parties.</p>

                      <p>The approach expects that the data is modelled using the RDF Data Cube vocabulary and has <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/#wf' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212226/http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:26Z'>Well-formed cubes</a></cite>. Essential checks for integrity constraints include: 1) a unique data structure definition (DSD) is used for a dataset, 2) the DSD includes a measure (value of each observation), 3) concept dimensions have code lists, and 4) codes are from the code lists.</p>

                      <p>In order to compare variables in observations across statistical datasets, there needs to be an agreement on the concepts that are being matched for in respective observations. In the case of regression analysis, the primary concern is about reference areas (ie. locations), and making sure that the comparison made for the observations from dataset<sub>x</sub> (independent variable) and dataset<sub>y</sub> (dependent variable) are using concepts that are interlinked (using the property <code>skos:exactMatch</code>). Practically, a concept eg. Switzerland, from at least one of the dataset\u2019s code lists should have a relation to the other dataset\u2019s concept. It ensures that there is a reliable degree of confidence that the particular concept is interchangeable or the degree in which the concepts being comparable. Hence, the measure corresponding to the phenomenon being observed, is about the same location in both datasets. To this end, concepts in the datasets were interlinked.</p>

                      <p>In order to foster trust and confidence for data consumers (human and machine), the analysis is accompanied with provenance data. The analysis includes a <cite><a rel='cito:usesConclusionsFrom' href='https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/UI#OhYeah' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212226/https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/UI' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:26Z'>Oh yeah?</a></cite> reference (in HTML as well as in RDF serializations) intended to guide the data consumer to a resource about the provenance activity \u2013 using the PROV-O vocabulary \u2013 about the performed analysis. These previously generated provenance activities provide links to all data sources which were used for the analysis, query construct for data aggregation, as well as metadata about the used tools, assigned license, production timestamps, and responsible agents for the generated analysis. Thus, in addition to analysis metadata, the user is able to track the data all the way back to its origins (at the statistical agencies), and reproduce or compare their results.</p>

                      <p>The proposed approach focuses on the scalability of the system with minimal human intervention. That is, new statistical dataset can be independently published while being expressed with relevant statistical vocabularies, and sufficient interlinks between concepts, then applications can discover them and perform queries in a uniform way. Hence, applications <em>only</em> need to be made aware of the location of new datasets.</p>

                  <p id='cyberspace-independence'>While the Internet reinforces democratic (re)distribution of communicative power, and the Web is inherently a decentralised social system, centralisation of all forms of information exchange and various forms of censorship \u2013 state or self-imposed \u2013 still occurs. In response to the <cite>Telecommunications Act of 1996</cite>, John Perry Barlow voiced a fundamental societal concern in <cite><a rel='cito:obtainsBackgroundFrom' href='https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20180828220312/https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence' data-versiondate='2018-08-28T22:03:12Z'>A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</a></cite> given the attempts of the <q>governments of the industrial world</q> to exert control over it, the builders of the cyberspace; a self-sovereign online society that is cross- border, culture, with diverse economies is ultimately an opposing force.</p>

                  <p id='information-control'>Over the years, large-scale centralised systems were built to collect, organise and share data in diverse sectors. The domination of centralisation is essentially due to economic and state incentives, and it has shaped the technical infrastructure: it is currently much easier and more efficient to author, manage, publish, read, and search large amounts of content using centralised services or proprietary platforms. As such the convenience that comes with centralisation is at the user\u2019s expense where ownership and access control is compromised, and ultimately the user\u2019s privacy and security. Moreover, from the service provider\u2019s perspective, there is no particular incentive to build interoperable systems as that would entail losing control over data. Since such services hinder information flow; information in one service is not necessarily usable by other applications and services and vice versa, they effectively form information silos \u2013 <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2008/Papers/MSNWS/index.html' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20180830094126/http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2008/Papers/MSNWS/index.html' data-versiondate='2018-08-30T09:41:26Z'>Decentralization: The Future of Online Social Networking</a></cite>, 2008.</p>

                  <p>In addition to state controlled network infrastructures, information empires like <cite>Google</cite>, <cite>Facebook</cite>, <cite>Amazon</cite>, <cite>Elsevier</cite>, as well as a long tail of (social media) services, exert a great deal of influence on how information can be accessed, expressed and reused. This influence impacts society, affecting the cost of accessing information, the effort required to produce and distribute, long-standing privacy concerns (in exchange of some convenience for users), as well as how and the amount of information that is aggregated, shared and filtered.</p>

                  <p id='trusting-centralised-services'>Independence from centralised services and platforms is a necessity for ownership of published ideas, and to establish authenticity and trust. For example, <cite>Facebook</cite> has been accused of <a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal'>data scandals</a>, <a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2016/05/yes_facebook_is_biased_now_it_should_admit_it.html'>bias</a>, <a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/12/how-technology-disrupted-the-truth'>false information</a>, and <a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/technology/facebook-vietnam-war-photo-nudity.html'>censorship</a> \u2013 but rather than blaming this on any particular service or platform, we identify it as an unavoidable result of centralisation. After all, there is a continued tension between unrestricted publication rights on the one hand, and a guarantee of balanced, verified information on the other. In a fully decentralised setting, each source is filterless and responsible for its own quality and reputation, while consumers are free to selectively (dis-)trust certain sources using any mechanism they desire, for example through trusted parties. This can have both favourable and unfavourable consequences depending on actual implementations. <cite>Google Search</cite> or <cite><a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://duckduckgo.com/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212227/https://duckduckgo.com/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:27Z'>DuckDuckGo</a></cite> for instance apply different filtering algorithms based on their Web crawls. Whether consciously or not, why we use a particular search engine naturally correlates with the amount of use or trust we have on that system. Similarly, as the academic peer review system acts as a layer to regulate credibility of academic contributions, we can approach the research results provided that there is sufficient provenance, accountability of the quality control processes, and able to distinguish different levels of certification given or lack of from the scholarly community.</p>

                  <p id='situation-challenges'>With the presumption that the major external forces \u2013 governments, companies \u2013 are at play, the situation for individual-controlled communication is complicated and ever challenging. Given that academic research is a global activity, it is important to acknowledge that the Web enables an environment in which actors in the space can both autonomously conduct their endeavours and participate in knowledge exchange. Hence, there is a need to <em>re-decentralise the Web</em> so that it benefits individuals, the public, as well as the scholarly communication market as a whole. We need to improve decentralisation and take further steps to apply it to research activities and scholarly publishing.</p>

These systems are conceived of as a graph where the nodes correspond to the components of the system, and the edges correspond to connections between them. From a global perspective, the Web is a decentralised system, however, it can have components which are disjoint from the rest of the graph.

Tramp highlights that there is an increased use of centralised social platforms, where users are locked in to their respective platforms with not much opportunity to communicate easily with users on other platforms, as well as difficulty to relocate their social graphs and personal data. Interoperability between platforms being largely limited to proprietary APIs, and changes being at the discretion of the service provider. Users of the online services are being required to keep their \u2013 often overlapping \u2013 data individually at each location up to date in order to minimise divergent information. Tramp argues that technical solutions should empower users to regain control and ownership over their data and its use, ensure privacy policies and rules that\u2019s user-centric (as opposed to driven by commercial interest), increased data security, information extensibility based on user\u2019s needs, reliability through distribution, and freedom of communication without centralised control.

                  <p>Both Tramp and Sambra approach from the perspective that the Web has proven itself architecturally and universality, and argue to extend the decentralised architecture for information reuse and user interaction. The core approaches use the Linked Data technology stack for publishing, retrieval, and integration; decoupling services and applications from the users data so that content creators are owners and have desired rights on their data and its use; and fostering data extensibility and distribution, as well as privacy.</p>

Similarly, when an HTTP URL is no longer available (eg. typical "404 Not Found", "410 Gone" status messages), the other URLs are not directly affected. This particular behaviour, where the Web being functional without requiring bi-directional hyperlinks is considered to be a "feature" (rather than a "bug") of the overall system. In the meantime, bi-directional links can still be established when so desired eg. as in the case with notifications.</p>

This is all meanwhile technically and legally enabling participants to retain their autonomy, identity and storage, access and rights over their contributions. In order to achieve this, one of the goals is to make an infrastructure where data and applications are decoupled by design. That is, an ability to work with Linked Data without constraints on which applications can be used, as long as they follow consensus-based open protocols and data models. At the core of this initiative is where users, groups, and applications use global identifiers (URIs), and  access control is applied using policies assigned to those identifiers. This also leads to the commodification of read-write data storage; the storage location on the Web can be decided by its owners and contributors, and it remains independent from the applications interacting with it.</p>

As representations of resources change over time, there is a need to preserve (archive and version) earlier representations. One common resource versioning pattern on the Web consists of generic URIs referring to the latest version of an accessible resource, as well as having a dedicated version URI for each resource. The Memento framework facilitates the discovery and retrieval of distributed versioned resources with datetime negotiation, a variant of content-negotiation; and TimeMaps an index of URIs referring to the prior states of a resource. The framework also helps to recognise frozen states of resources \u2013 a promise that the resource state has not and will not change.

The construction of an online identity of an entity eg. individual, organisation, community, state, can be complex in that it is interconnected with social and technical systems, and it can be issued \u2013 declared to exist, named, or be referenceable \u2013 in different ways. Entities being universally and uniquely identifiable on or off the Web entails that they can be attributed for their contributions, develop their reputations, be accountable for their actions and research output, as well as play an integral role towards building trust. An actor is an indispensable force in research communication, and enabling identity agency is both relevant and foundational.</p>

                  <p id='third-party-controlled-identity'><strong>Third-party controlled identity</strong>: Community or state controlled identifiers for identities are a class of identifiers that are ultimately third-party controlled in that their ownership, governance, description is beyond an individual\u2019s jurisdiction. The creation and control of identifiers by a group has the quality of long-term promise for persistence. Typically there are policies in place which promise their longevity, and procedures in the event that the group ceases to manage the identifiers. For example, ORCID URIs are intended to be part of the scholarly commons where they managed by the <cite><a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://orcid.org/about/community' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190729124641/https://orcid.org/about/community' data-versiondate='2019-07-29T12:46:41Z'>ORCID community</a></cite>. The ORCID URI and profile description is useful to researchers, organisations, as well as to interlink researcher objects, however it is ultimately intended to serve the research community, and the systems that use it. One unintended consequence of this kind of centralisation in scholarly communication is that a growing number of institutions and publishers require researchers to participate with their ORCID identifiers, as opposed to any URI of a researcher. The resulting effects of <cite><a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://orcid.org/content/requiring-orcid-publication-workflows-open-letter' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190729124642/https://orcid.org/content/requiring-orcid-publication-workflows-open-letter' data-versiondate='2019-07-29T12:46:42Z'>such initiatives</a></cite> are counter to autonomous participation in that a researcher has to conform to the terms and policies of multiple third-parties. On the other hand, the administration of the URI by the ORCID organisation removes the burden of maintaining the URI as well as the profile URL. In this case, a "trusted" third-party takes care of the identifier, whereas researchers are responsible of updating the content.</p>

                  <p id='researcher-identifier-academic-freedom'>While some scholarly societies adopt identifiers like ORCID given their agreed potential benefits, it can also be harmful in the case of tracking researchers; where they work, who they work for or collaborate with, what they work on.

The collected user data is shared with ad networks and data brokers. Unauthorised third-party tracking of users online activities is particularly concerning even in the case of <em>public sector</em> websites, which are expected to be more privacy respecting than "ordinary" websites (as per <abbr title='General Data Protection Regulation'>GDPR</abbr> in the EU).

                  <p id='multiple-identities'><strong>Multiple identities</strong>: Individuals may want to be associated with multiple identities to fulfill diverse needs and social expectations. For instance, academics, politicians, employees, and artists, to name a few, may want to perform their online activities using public identifiers, so that they can be discovered, attributed, rewarded, trusted etc. There can also be quasi-public identities issued by a government or a bank to connect individuals to the physical world. Furthermore, individuals may wish to have several personal \u2013 public or private \u2013 identities and self representations, eg. on social networks, to address different needs. At any event, identities and corresponding identifiers can be registered and managed by different entities, and may be interlinked.</p>

                  <p id='orcid-sameas-webid'>For instance, while ORCID profile description has constraints, it allows extensibility in the form of asserting a "same as" relation through its UI, so that the ORCID URI can be linked to other WebIDs. This essentially makes a connection to another <cite><a href='#self-describing'>self-describing document</a></cite> and facilitates <cite><a href='#follow-your-nose'>follow your nose</a></cite> discovery. My personal WebID which is under my control is <a href='https://csarven.ca/#i'>https://csarven.ca/#i</a>. I also have an ORCID identifier that also serves as a WebID: <a href='https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0880-9125'>https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0880-9125</a> which also has an RDF representation. As ORCID\u2019s user interface allows people to extend their descriptions with certain fields, it is possible to add <em>same as</em> or <em>preferred URI</em> relations:</p>

                  <p id='linking-identities'>The <code class='highlight-predicate-sameas'>owl:sameAs</code> and <code>contact:preferredURI</code> information provides an opportunity for applications consuming the ORCID WebID to potentially discover more information about other entities. This is particularly useful as the ORCID WebID Profile is not completely open to add arbitrary information. For example, specifying a person\u2019s picture or their contacts is not currently possible with ORCID, however, if the alternative profiles (https://csarven.ca/#i) contain such information, they can be purposed to know more about the entity.</p>

                  <p id='social-graph'><strong>Social Graph</strong>: Identity profiles can further describe their relationships to other identities and hence form a network of self-described profiles. This is useful in that relationships between profiles of people, groups, organisations, and even software agents can manifest an information space that at its core has social affordances. That is, different kinds of relationships between entities can be expressed for different use cases, where each identity is independently controlled by its owners. For example:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>identifying a layer of trusted (or acknowledged) network of people</li>
                    <li>sending notifications to the members of one\u2019s personal social graph</li>
                    <li>discovering annotations made by a particular social graph</li>

                  <p id='trust'>Trust is ultimately tied to verifiable claims about identity and their provenance. While the creation and protection of third-party controlled online identities have received much focus, claiming and using personal identities online is still a challenge. Today\u2019s Web applications predominantly make use of online identities that are essentially tied to and controlled by authorities in which users are merely borrowing an identifier and its management. It is a common practice to where users are required to create accounts at each online service they wish to use, eg. social media sites. Moreover, the trust model of such design dictates claims and usage of online identities is not ultimately in the hands of the users, and can be taken away from the users by the owners of the URIs and service at any time and reason. Even in cases where third-party issues identities can be used across different services, it is subject to a privacy violation as the identity provider essentially gets to know which services the user\u2019s online identity is used with and for what purpose. Consequently such services can gradually build up information about users\u2019 actions as well as behavioural patterns on the Web. Lastly, portability and interoperability of the identities is generally under developed as there is no particular incentive for an identity provider to make it so \u2013 after all, providing \u201cfree\u201d services for online identities, and then locking identities to well-defined circle of services is taken advantage of by large corporations given their business models. Perhaps most importantly, such online services (as well as applications) do not recognise the identity of users as a distinct notion from the applications and services they use towards authentication.</p>

A public key cryptographic system uses a pair of keys: public keys (disseminated openly) and private keys (withheld by the owner). It has two main functions: authentication and encryption. For authentication, public key verifies that a holder of the paired private key sent the message. In the case of encryption, for example, when Guinan wants to send Picard a message, Guinan takes Picard\u2019s public key to encrypt a message where only Picard can decrypt the message with his private key. WoT essentially leaves trust decisions to the users, as opposed to a centralised authority. Thus, WoT uses self-signed certificates and third-party attestation of those certificates, eg. at <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signing_party' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190729124642/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signing_party' data-versiondate='2019-07-29T12:46:42Z'>key signing parties</a></cite>.

As the extension mechanism in X.509 allows additional statements to be specified under the <code>Subject Alternative Name</code> (<abbr title='Subject Alternative Name'>SAN</abbr>) field, it is used to declare the user\u2019s WebID for the <code>URI</code> field. When a client application running on the Web browser requests a resource from the server, the TLS connection gets established between them. Once TLS has been set up, the HTTP application protocol exchange takes place (eg. <code>HTTP GET</code>, <code>HTTP POST</code>). If the requested resource requires WebID authentication the server can request the client to authenticate itself. When the Web browser encounters this certificate request, it may prompt its user to choose a certificate (from its certificate manager) \u2013 thereby signing a token with its private key \u2013 to let the client send it to the server. The verification agent extracts the public key as well as the WebID from the certificate. As the WebID enables a global dereferencing mechanism for finding a key, the server uses can decide on dereferencing the WebID Profile and verify the claims about the WebID. Once the identity verification is established, the server can look up its access control rules for the requested resource to determine if and how the request can be fulfilled. Researchers can use servers and applications implementing the WebID-TLS workflow towards securely identifying profile claims and to have access to resources may be otherwise protected.</p>

                  <p>As knowledge builds on knowledge, it is vital to preserve the connection between units of information in scholarly communication. There are a number of challenges in this respect. In this section I focus on the persistence of the identifiers for units, as well as content integrity and preservation of context. In the most general sense, trust and accessibility are integral to preservation of content, integrity, and the context in which they are used. This is so that knowledge can be scrutinised with the help of transparent trail of reproducibility and replicability of research results.

The article focuses on practices that a publisher making a commitment to persistence by designing and managing the URI path and the content it resolves to, as well as the domain name it uses. The owner of a domain name has the obligation to define what the things mean for its URIs. This is also a form of social contract made by the authority that names and defines a URI to anyone that\u2019s using it \u2013 see also <cite><a rel='cito:obtainsBackgroundFrom' href='https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/PhilosophicalEngineering' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212245/https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/PhilosophicalEngineering' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:45Z'>Philosophical Engineering and Ownerhip of URIs</a></cite>.</p>

                  <p id='persistence-policies'>Persistence policies can come in different forms.

These human-readable statements are useful institutional commitment to persistence. The ODRL vocabulary can be used in a similar way to provide a machine-readable policy about resources.</p>

                  <p id='uri-social-agreement'>From the archiving perspective, Van de Sompel came to the conclusion that in a long enough timeline, HTTP URIs are not inherently persistent but persistable. The units of information that are registered using URIs are more of a promise made by its original or current authority. Hence, along with the examples from earlier, URI registration is ultimately a social agreement. URI owners declare a policy eg. implicit, written, verbal. If a policy is announced for a collection of URIs eg. what happens in 1000 years, then that says something about its intentions and expected level of availability. From this perspective, as discussed earlier in the <cite><a href='#registration-of-identifiers'>registration of identifiers with social contracts</a></cite>, <abbr title='Persistent Identifier'>PID</abbr>s such as DOI, PURL, w3id, and ORCID can help to prolong such promises and to extend the lifetime of accessibility of units of scholarly information.</p>

The results show that within a few years of the URL being cited, 45% of the URLs referenced from arXiv still exist but are not preserved, and 28% of the resources referenced by articles in the UNT digital library have been lost. In order to address this commonly known as URIs ceasing to exist (link rot), authors suggest that repositories expose the links in the articles through an API so that Web crawlers can be used to archive. With the help of archives supporting the Memento protocol, the original context of the citation can still be reconstructed.</p>

The results show that significant amount of HTTP URIs cited in STM articles are no longer responsive or adequate archived snapshots available. Authors state that it is impossible to adequately recreate the temporal context of the scholarly discourse, hence suggest that robust solutions are needed to combat the problem of reference rot. Authors can take practical steps to remedy some of these issues eg. using archives that support on-demand snapshots, embedding the archived URI with datetime information alongside the reference to the original resource \u2013 I discuss this further in <cite><a href='#robust-links'>Robust Links</a></cite>.</p>

However, the authors also state that such robust embedding in the infrastructure of the existing authoring, reviewing, and publishing workflow is still an open challenge. To that end, applying the <cite><a href='#robust-links'>Robust Links</a></cite> approach can help. While the DOI-paradigm for scholarly units help to improve the link rot scenario when the custodians of the domains or the URLs of the scholarly resources relocate, the resources on the Web at large remain to be a problem given that their incentives towards longevity and access differ.</p>

                  <p id='persistent-domains-content-drift'>From the point of persistence of the domain name (losing ownership) as Berners-Lee describes, one kind of content drift would be if the content published at https://csarven.ca/ today may be different tomorrow if another authority gets to own csarven.ca and defines what goes there. Alternatively, it may be that the content at that location is dynamic, and could differ from one request to another. In both cases, content drift creates a situation where if the originally referenced resource is still the same. From the perspective of Web-based scholarly publications, changes to content \u2013 accidental or intentional \u2013 can impact the degree of reproducibility, replicability, comparability of research results, and maintaining a reliable scholarly record.</p>

For example, the PID paradigm has the following discovery path:</p>

                  <ol>
                    <li>PID is the resource identifier eg. <samp>10.2218/ijdc.v9i1.320</samp></li>
                    <li>HTTP-URI-PID is the resolving URI eg. <samp>https://doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v9i1.320</samp></li>
                    <li>HTTP-URI-LAND is the redirect URI (landing page) eg. <samp>http://www.ijdc.net/article/view/9.1.331</samp></li>
                    <li>HTTP-URI-LOC is the location URI of the content eg. <samp>http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/9.1.331/362/</samp></li>
                  </ol>

                  <p>Authors propose that using existing standards and practice, the essential ingredients for such a mapping is as follows. A PID has a Web equivalent HTTP-URI-PID, which is a requisite \u2013 minted by the naming authority. The HTTP-URI-PID can be content-negotiated to result in a) a human-readable representation at HTTP-URI-LAND or b) machine-readable representations with distinct HTTP-URI-MACH. The HTTP-URI-LAND remains the same for discovery, however, HTTP-URI-MACH uses an RDF-based approach to describe the aggregations of scholarly assets based on the OAI-ORE specification.</p>

                  <p id='pid-uri-ownership'>It is worth briefly revisiting the notion of social agreements around Web resources. Conceptually, the agreement that I make with you about the persistence of my website\u2019s resources is in essence the same as a naming authority controlling a PID, as well as all of the nodes in between HTTP-URI-LOC. The kind of mapping between a domain name and the IP address it points to is similar to a PID being mapped to a HTTP-URI-PID. Hence, <em>URI Ownership</em> essentially involves two possibilities: either I \u201cown\u201d and control a URI space or someone else does.</p>

In order to preserve the context of linked resources at the time of linking, a <em>link robustness</em> strategy is applied by way of creating a snapshot of the original resource and making it available to data consumers. The <cite>Link Decoration</cite> approach decorates links in hypertext documents in order to be human- and machine-actionable. By additionally associating the datetime information when linking helps to retain such context. The datetime information can be accompanied with a snapshot of the target URI made at a Web archive or a versioning system when linking, and using either the original or the versioned resource as the primary reference. Including datetime information in the source document can make it possible to interpret the context of each of the links in the document and to discover relevant snapshots. In the event that a linked resource or a snapshot becomes inaccessible, the datetime information helps to discover temporally close alternative snapshots.</p>

Trusty URI artifacts are considered to be permanent in that once archived or cached, the artifact can still be verified even if the original location is no longer available.

As per the client\u2013server model, their arrangement generally falls in the spectrum of tightly or loosely coupled architectures.

More specifically, <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='http://www2009.eprints.org/92/1/p911.pdf' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190529163945/http://www2009.eprints.org/92/1/p911.pdf' data-versiondate='2019-05-29T16:39:45Z'>Why is the Web Loosely Coupled?

                  <p id='webid-loose-coupling'>Loose coupling reduces the number of assumptions each party makes about the other when exchanging information. For instance, AWWW includes various protocols for interaction, URIs to identify, and standard data formats to communicate the content. The Linked Data design principles then sets further constraints within this framework by favouring HTTP URIs, and the RDF language. A Linked Data driven system using uniform interaction and information exchange can be viewed to be more tightly coupled in comparison to an arbitrary system that is less specified or unspecified. Corollary, the loosely coupled systems set a higher requirement for using Web specifications emerging through open consensus as well as being widely deployed in order for the ecosystem to function. Otherwise, it would be impossible to communicate if there is no higher-order agreement. The loose coupling of interoperable systems based on open standards however can go beyond the arrangement of clients and servers. For instance, the notion of WebID enables loose coupling of identity, identification, authentication, authorization, and storage.</p>

In contrast to third-party controlled centralised systems, decentralised systems can have persistent availability (globally), resistance to external censorship, monopoly disruption, increased interest in privacy and security, and enable free expression with respect to information structure and semantics. In order for decentralised datastores to be effective, both servers and client application have an increased requirement on implementing consensus-based open standards in order to cultivate an interoperable ecosystem.</p>

While the hosting has usage limits, it is considered to be economical and have reliability features put in place by the host\u2019s system administrators. Any website with its own domain name can act as an independent node in a decentralised system. However, given that multiple websites reside on the same server, system-wide configuration changes or disruptions on the network usually effects all of the websites. Moreover, there are privacy and security concerns if the information on or transferring through individual dataspaces are not encrypted.

A generic PDS can be virtually realised with any HTTP server with varying configurations and capabilities offering client-side applications to communicate through open protocols and data formats. Web resources that are only intended for public read entails that the custodian allows resources to be available in response to client requests. Servers would need to factor in an authentication mechanism and authorization rules to determine who to serve the resources to and under which access constraints.

An individual responsible for a PDS entails that they are responsible as well as accountable of its operation, abilities, policies and practice decisions on data, persistence strategies and so forth. PDS makes it possible for actors to safeguard their data by setting authentication and authorization rules for any or class of agents, being able to act as the source of truth for WebIDs and the descriptions in the profiles. Running a PDS fundamentally requires the system to fulfill the registration function for the content it makes available. As archiving is an external function, we expect other services to meet that requirement. The certification function can be fulfilled in a similar manner to registration in that the actors that are involved in the quality-control process can register their own units of information in their PDS in response to target units.</p>

                <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                  <p>I use the same set of questions raised in <cite>Systematizing Decentralization and Privacy</cite> to study the design choices for an actor-controlled system based in context of the <cite><a href='#architecture-of-the-web'>Architecture of the Web</a></cite>:</p>

                  <dl>

                    <dd>The nodes in the system are the Web resources on servers that make up information such as profiles, articles, annotations and notifications, as well archived snapshots. The advantage of this infrastructure is that once a resource is registered (named and stored), they do not require users for its availability or functionality \u2013 a reduced attack surface. Users retain their privacy in that, access and use of resources are encapsulated, and such information about identity or actions taken is not required to spread to the rest of the network. In the case of compound resources including information from distributed resources, like with transclusions, or applications dynamically fetching information from different context, nodes may get to be aware of cross-origin requests. The <em>network topology</em> is by default <em>point-to-point</em>, ie. connections between two endpoints. However, in the case of federated servers, information can be routed and disseminated to the whole network, for example, an actor sends out a notification about their activity. The <em>authority topology</em> is that nodes (client-server or server-server) <em>interact directly</em> with each other, without necessarily requiring third-party nodes to participate. In order to establish trust, a certain amount of transparency can be used to make an authority <em>accountable</em>. In federated designs, users place their trust on their provider nodes who act as authorities on their behalf with other providers (server-server).</dd>

                    <dt id='what-advantages-do-we-get-from-decentralizing'>What advantages do we get from decentralizing?</dt>
                    <dd>There is no single point of failure, has high availability, system performance, and generally <em>survivable</em>. However, the system\u2019s usefulness may degrade if certain resources in the network disappear or become inaccessible. For example, if a notification about an annotation is no longer available, then the annotation may need to be discovered through other routes. There is a flexible trust model in that, there is <em>no natural central authority</em>. Multiple independent authorities exist, and each verify claims based on their own (or shared) decisions eg. self-signed certificates as part of web of trust, or in the case of <em>anyone can say anything about anything</em>, consumers of such information verify the statements based on their needs. There is a <em>distributed allocation of resources assists ease of deployment</em>, and independent extensibility. As with the open-world assumption, nodes are not expected to have complete knowledge, and conflicting knowledge can enter the system. Decentralised systems while benefit from network <em>location diversity</em>, they may also be subject to censored both on the network and legal levels. The <em>development and operation is decoupled</em> in that open software can be publicly visible and auditable before being used by authorities. Original resources as well as versioned or archived copies can have <em>publicly verifiable integrity</em>. Decentralised system are relatively secure in that compromising or weakening the system requires attackers to engage with different services, or code bases. <em>Public accountability</em> can be devised to detect and exclude misinformation, as well as misbehaving or compromised actors. A decentralised system can incorporate trusted centralised nodes eg. community agreed scholarly reviews, archives, caching servers, proxies, and so forth, while if compromised by adversaries or disappearance is temporarily kept local \u2013 possibly a performance or discovery problem.</dd>

                    <dt id='how-does-decentralization-support-privacy'>How does decentralization support privacy?</dt>
                    <dd>Due to the way resources are distributed in decentralised systems, they offer greater user data privacy with respect to their communication, identities, and actions than centralised systems in that there is no single authority that can observe all data and interactions. In essence, it makes it challenging for an adversary to aggregate and connect all information in a way that can undeniably hold a participant in the system accountable. These systems can allow different degrees of confidential participation in that agents (human or machine) can remain anonymous or use their pseudonymous identities. For instance, sensitive research data can be kept confidential. Access controlled resources can be accessible by trusted parties. Actions of an actor can potentially be unlinkable and so rendering a global search of information useless. The communication between parties can be undetectable and unobservable by unauthorised third-parties.</dd>

                    <dt id='what-are-the-disadvantages-of-decentralizing'>What are the disadvantages of decentralizing?</dt>
                    <dd>Decentralised systems inherently increases the number of attack vectors that an adversary can use due to number of software implementations and configurations. A compromised node in the network can potentially monitor activities, corrupt information exchange, insert malicious code, distribute data to interested parties while undetected, reduce or expose anonymity, provide inconsistent views, and so forth. As there is no single authority to globally manage the nodes in the network, the quality and availability of the services will vary and becomes challenging for each node to actively and effectively protect themselves. For example, an article, its inbox, and the annotations referred from each notification may all reside at different network locations, and thus data consumers would need to factor in potential issues arising from each node by defending themselves or routing around disturbances. Decentralisation also poses an obstacle for accountability and reputation in that while actors may control a node, handling the ramifications of a misbehaved node becomes difficult in the broader ecosystem. Finding, discovering, and interactions on fine-grained resources are typically less efficient than centralised systems.</dd>

                    <dt id='what-implicit-centralized-assumptions-remain'>What implicit centralized assumptions remain?</dt>
                    <dd>Decentralised systems include social and technical aspects of centralisations. The DNS is the most prominent example of centralisation in that domain names are administered by an entity other than the actors interacting in the information space. The name which resolves to a node is generally governed by a single authority solely determining the level of privacy the node offers as well as its availability. For instance, since registration of units of communication are mere records of content, their persistence and preservation are at the discretion of the owners of the URI space. Thus, archiving by trusted parties is necessary to take into account \u2013 which essentially introduces additional centralised entities. The use of certain certification authorities also introduces hierarchically structured centralised governance into the system, hence fundamentally allowing single entities to revoke authenticate credentials, or eventually influencing abuse-prevention, reputation, and trust. Along these lines, carrying out access policy management and enforcement by independent nodes introduces central locations for potential attacks. Web standards are a form of social centralisation in that they reflect the participants\u2019 norms and agenda. Similarly, content delivery networks, for wide reuse introduces a single point of failure for large number of services \u2013 a potential risk even for open-source software.</dd>

                  </figure>

                  <p>On one end of the spectrum, an actor eg. an individual, registers their own domain name, hosts their personal storage, and uses applications of their choosing. With that, they have highest degree of autonomy. On the other end of the spectrum, an individual\u2019s identifier as well as a range of expressible identities, the data location and conditions of use, and assigned applications by third-party services.</p>

                  <p>I focus on interactions based on the <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190729124643/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model' data-versiondate='2019-07-29T12:46:43Z'>client\u2013server model</a></cite> under the <cite><a href='#architecture-of-the-web'>Architecture of the Web</a></cite>, identifiers and data are conceptually decoupled components. In the case of identifiers, I focus mainly on HTTP-based URIs, and the social conventions around <cite><a href='#uri-ownership'>URI Ownership</a></cite>. Finally, the applications comprise software that actors can use.</p>

                  <p>While centralisation of data and applications are two distinct areas of concern, some of the challenges we face in scholarly communication make them appear as one. When we discuss challenges around access to knowledge, the location and quality of the data is often conflated with the tools or services which are required to access the data. Being required to use particular software to create, format or share research articles, to create accounts on particular services, or agree to certain terms and conditions impose a set of characteristics on research output or data itself.</p>

                  <p>Data and application appear to be intertwined because the workflows that the researchers are required to use tend to be unique and proprietary and predominantly enforced by third-parties. While some of the differences in designs may be due to historical reasons they also ensure various forms of vendor lock-in on both the research outputs and the applications to generate, share and reuse data. The use of non-interoperable (or even post-facto) methods to create and exchange data on the Web leads to the fragmentation of data through silo-services, and along with it the dependency on applications having their interaction mechanisms established via out-of-band knowledge. By strictly focusing on the current quality of machine-readable scholarly information on the Web, the technical obstacles are evident and ample. The applications need to be continuously hard-wired to know where and what to look for; what to do once something of interest is found; or where to go next in the discovery phase. Similarly, automating discovery of fine-grained information without human interference is still central to the limitations.</p>

                  <p>Different degrees of control would influence the forces and functions in scholarly communication. For instance, while ORCID is community controlled, it is possible for individuals to customise their profiles and to link to their other identities. The profile description can indicate the location of researcher\u2019s personal online storage, inbox, as well as outbox, which can be controlled by the individual. The DOI system on the other hand is governed by an organisation where the mapping between an identifier and the location of content they refer to is managed by select few organisations (as opposed to individuals).</p>

                <h3 property='schema:name'>The Effects and Artifacts of Autonomous Engagement</h3>
                <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                  <p>The Web\u2019s design stands out because of its absence of centralised control, both for technical reasons of scalability and resilience as well as a societal need to exercise creative and effective communication. A challenge in such large-scale decentralised networks is how related publications can be semantically interlinked, even if they are authored and published by different parties. Centralising their publications is practiced by the majority of authoring networks today, demanding authors to give up some or all of their control in exchange for technical simplicity.</p>

                  <p>We can approach an alternative to this centralisation by adopting Web-centric workflows that are inherently interoperable by design, but most importantly by enabling the creators and the users of data and applications to be autonomous entities, working towards the democratisation of scholarly knowledge for humans and machines. One way to achieve this is by decentralisation and decoupling of data and applications. By <dfn typeof='skos:Concept' resource='#concept-scheme' rel='skos:topConceptOf' property='skos:prefLabel' id='concept-decentralisation' about='#concept-decentralisation'>decentralisation</dfn>, I mean <span property='skos:definition' about='#concept-decentralisation'>data and applications are loosely coupled, and users can choose where their data is stored. I focus on Web-based decentralisation, where content is transported over HTTP, and resources are identified with URIs.</span></p>

                  <p>The future of self-registration of scholarly units depends in large part on how well its practitioners, advocates, educators alike, are able to reconcile the ideals that the medium offers with the realities of the commercial third-party systems within which scholarly communication operates and the homogenizing influences of scholarly socialisation.</p>

                  <p>While these challenges are technically surmountable, they need to be taken seriously if, the extreme case where <em>anyone can say anything about anything</em> is subject to be treated on equal grounds as a piece of information that is well certified. One contemporary and popular example of this scenario is where nearly all scientists being in agreement on the presence of global warming, climate change, and its consequences. In order to honour a commitment to public service, scientific communication \u2013 independent to self-registration \u2013 must remain grounded on reproducible and replicable facts and explanations, as well as pertain attributable and accountable participants. The output affects society, from journalism, advancement of scientific knowledge, policy making, as well public opinion and perception.</p>

                  <p>Decentralised authoring, publication, and annotation furthermore have the potential to impact areas in which centralised services currently determine the pace of evolution. Scientific publishing, for instance, is often bound to centralised review and dissemination processes. Instead, rigorous scientific discourse can still be realised with an open, decentralised environment for the annotation of manuscripts, which can potentially reach interested parties in a timely manner. Trust then no longer stems from a finite process with limited transparency, but is rather continuously assessed by repeated independent validation. Publication thereby becomes the starting point rather than the end point of the scholarly communication process. An application built with interoperable open Web standards can potentially communicate with services that conform to the same protocols and data models.</p>

                  <p id='non-functional-requirements'><strong>Non-Functional Requirements</strong>: While there are plethora of <cite>architecturally significant requirements</cite> such as institutional or orientations in society and industry, I focus on non-functional and functional requirements which enable personal and academic freedom, in particular to creating affordances towards autonomy and interoperable participation on the open Web. I derive non-functional requirements for systems to aim at addressing the forces and functions in scientific communication through the following:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><em>Interoperability</em> to improve discovery, accessibility, integrability, and reusability.</li>
                    <li><em>Security and privacy</em> to honour desire to remain safe and information not to be shared without consent.</li>
                    <li><em>Modularity and extensibility</em> to enable evolvable and reconfigurable systems.</li>
                    <li><em>Data integrity, transparency, and reliability</em> towards building trust.</li>
                    <li><em>Persistence and preservation</em> to ensure that units of scholarly information preserves into the future.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>In order to support publishers and consumers (in the most general sense of <em>actor</em> roles), it is important to seek system designs that give control to its users at various fronts. This is to foster a scholarly ecosystem where users having the means to participate:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>by creating and using their preferred identifiers for identities and data;</li>
                    <li>by deciding what can access data and under which conditions;</li>
                    <li>by using different applications on the same data for different purposes.</li>

                  <p>As scholarly content is created and registered, becoming globally identifiable on the Web, the next challenge is to ensure it is <em>findable</em> and <em>discoverable</em> within a decentralised system.</p>
                  <p>I have <a href='#decentralising-scholarly-communication'>reviewed</a> a number of Web standards and specifications pertaining to <a href='#read-write-linked-data'>read-write Linked Data</a>, vocabularies about <a href='#publishing-and-referencing'>publishing resources</a> and <a href='#participation'>social participation</a>, and explained how they can be combined in various ways to realise a wide array of scholarly and social activities in a decentralised fashion. This section describes the design and standardisation of a decentralised notification system that works on the HTTP application layer.</p>

                  <p>Notifications are sent over the Web for a variety of purposes, including social applications: <q>You have been invited to a vegan lunch!</q>, <q>Guinan annotated your article</q>, <q>Eunice tagged you in a photo</q>. The notification data may be displayed to a human to acknowledge, or used to trigger some other application-specific process (or both). Such notifications are also useful as part of a decentralised scholarly communications ecosystem, primarily for fulfilling the <em>awareness</em> function.</p>

                  <p>Notifications are a common part of many centralised Web applications, and variety of uses are in social media. In this case, notifications are structured arbitrarily and are typically only usable by the sanctioned applications or those that generated them in the first place. So far, notifications are <em>ephemeral</em> resources which may disappear after delivery, and thus are not designed for reuse. In such systems, communication and semantic interoperability across independently built applications is not expected. This design however places limitations on possible interactions around a notification. For example, current major social media services on the Web act as disjoint closed ecosystems, commonly known as <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform'>walled gardens</a></q> in contrast to open platforms with more possibilities for extensibility and reuse of applications and content. In essence, notification data is locked into particular systems, and users are restricted to using tightly coupled applications. Such software and systems are only capable of exchanging notifications if they have prior knowledge about the actors involved, location of the data, data formats, and user interfaces. Customarily, switching applications entails switching social providers, and having to create new profiles, and yet again reconnect or build one\u2019s social network in the new system from scratch. This scenario is analogous to using an email application that\u2019s customised to each service provider, and only being able to send and receive emails from people that use the same provider. In order for information to flow between systems customised communication interfaces or APIs need to be created after the fact, thus imposing additional maintenance tax for systems to cooperate.</p>

                  <p>In a decentralised architecture, notifications can be a key element for federation of information, and application integration. Current efforts towards <em>re-decentralising</em> the Web are moving towards architectures in which data storage is decoupled from application logic, freeing end users to switch between applications, or to let multiple applications operate over the same data.</p>

                  <p>Similarly for a decentralised scholarly Web, notification data should not be locked into particular systems. Data generated from independently built applications should be discoverable and increase their chance for reusability by other applications. Users can choose where to store their notifications as well as using their preferred applications to create, discover, and consume the data.</p>

                  <p>This section addresses the following <a href='#research-questions'>research question</a> for this thesis:</p>

                  <p>The following are core requirements of a notifications protocol in context of <cite><a href='#degree-of-control'>Degree of Control</a></cite>:</p>

                    <li>Actors switching between applications without having to move their data.</li>
                    <li>Actors change the location of their data without having to change their application.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>In the following subsections I review existing decentralised protocols for notifications, and then outline use cases for notifications in scholarly communication. These use cases yield key design considerations, which are taken into account for the design of a new protocol \u2013 Linked Data Notifications (LDN) \u2013 which can be implemented to meet the awareness function for scholarly communication in decentralised systems, as well as meet the degree of control requirements listed above. LDN also supports systems with respect to the registration, certification and archiving functions.</p>

                  <p>I developed LDN and served as the specification editor as part of the W3C Social Web Working Group (<abbr title='Social Web Working Group'>SWWG</abbr>), and LDN became a W3C Recommendation in May 2017.

                <h3 property='schema:name'>Overview of Web Notification Systems</h3>
                <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                  <p>Many systems which make use of notifications operate either in a completely centralised way, or are decentralised only in the sense that different instances of the <em>same</em> codebase need to interoperate; this review is restricted to mechanisms which do not expect the notification to be received or used only by the same software or platform which sent it.</p>

                  <p>Existing decentralised notification mechanisms can be grouped according to the notification contents. Notification contents are either: 1) One or more URLs, indicating relations between Web resources (aka a \u2018thin ping\u2019), or 2) a \u2018fat ping\u2019 containing a blob of information. Semantic Pingback, Webmention, and Provenance Pingback follow the first form, and are also known as <cite>linkbacks</cite>, the suite of protocols that essentially allows Web documents to automatically reciprocate hyperlinks. This has the advantage that a verification mechanism can be tightly specified (the URL of the target must appear in the content of the source), but the disadvantage that notifications are generally suitable for website publishing. Fat pings, in contrast, are flexible and extensible in that payloads can be in any content type, carry any information, and be used for various use cases.</p>

Resources which are the target for a notification advertise the respective receiving service or endpoint via a <code>Link</code> relation, either in HTTP headers or HTML. Semantic Pingback additionally enables discovery of the Pingback service where target description is available in RDF. While the content at source may indicate (in any convention or serialisation format) the type of relation between the source and target URLs, this information about the relation is not transmitted to the receiver\u2019s endpoint; only the source and target URLs are sent. As such, there is also no way to deterministically distinguish between multiple mentions of the target at the source based on the information in the mention. Hence, each receiver implementation is responsible for interpreting the underlying information at the source, thereby potentially inconsistent across implementations. In contrast, Semantic Pingback does encourage generation of additional semantics about the relation(s) between the source and the target by processing the source as RDF if possible, and also defines specific ways for a receiving server to handle incoming pingback data in order to add the source data to an RDF knowledge base. Beyond verifying that the source contains the URL of the target, Webmention does not specify any further requirements of the receiving server; nor is it expected that \u201cmentions\u201d are retrievable once they have been sent.</p>

Subscribers send a request with a topic of interest \u2013 the URL of a resource \u2013 to a hub and specify a location where content can be delivered to. When a publisher informs a hub about content changes, a hub then handles the distribution by sending a copy of the content that a publisher makes available to the subscriber\u2019s preferred location.

                  <p>A useful decentralised notification protocol would be able to realise some of these use cases for scholars. In the next section I describe specific design considerations derived from these uses cases, which can be used to inform the design of the protocol.</p>

                <h3 property='schema:name'>Design Considerations</h3>
                <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                  <p>This section details design considerations for a decentralised notification protocol are based on the <cite><a href='#use-cases-for-decentralised-notifications'>Use Cases for Decentralised Notifications</a></cite>. I will take conformance to the Linked Data design principles into account, as well as Web application best practices. I use these considerations to establish the concrete requirements and the points of implementation-specific flexibility for the protocol.</p>

                  <p>The non-functional features include: modularity, reusability, persistence and retrievability, adaptability. The functional features include: target representation, notification body, notification verification, subscribing.</p>

                  <p id='modularity'><strong>Modularity</strong> (<a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#modularity'>R1</a>): To encourage modularity of applications, one should differentiate between different classes of implementation of the protocol. Two parties are involved in the creation of a notification: a <em>sender</em>, generating the notification data, and a <em>receiver</em>, storing the created resource. We also have the role of a <em>consumer</em>, which reads the notification data made available by a receiver, and repurposes it in some way. A software implementation can of course play two or all three of these roles; the important part is that it need not. A consuming application can read and use notification data without being concerned about ever sending or storing notifications.</p>

                  <p id='reusability'><strong>Reusability</strong> (<a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#reusable-notifications'>R2</a>): The relationship between the <em>consumer</em> and <em>receiver</em> roles is key to notifications being reusable. A consumer must be able to autonomously find the location of notifications for or about the particular resource it is interested in. To achieve this, we place a requirement on the receiver to expose notifications it has been sent in such away to permit consumer applications to access them; and specify how any resource can advertise its receiving endpoint for consumers to discover. To promote fair use or remixing of notification contents, applications can incorporate rights and licensing information into the data. Similarly, applications may include additional information on licensing resources that the notification refers to. The presence of this type of information is important for consumers to assess the (re)usability of data.</p>

                  <p id='persistence-and-retrievability'><strong>Persistence and Retrievability</strong> (<a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#persistence-and-retrievability'>R3</a>): Given the traditionally ephemeral nature of notifications, here we refer to persistence as units of information that can be registered. Applications may benefit from referring to or reusing notifications if the notifications are known to be retrievable in the long term, or indicate their expected lifespan. This enforces the notion that notifications are considered resources in their own right, with their own dereferencable URIs.</p>

                  <p id='adaptability'><strong>Adaptability</strong> (<a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#adaptability'>R4</a>): A notification protocol should be adaptable for different domains, but that there is no need to create multiple domain-specific notification protocols; the fundamental mechanics are the same given the three main architectural layers of the Web \u2013 identification, interaction, data formats.</p>

                  <p id='target-representation'><strong>Target representation</strong> (<a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#target-representation'>R4-A</a>): Any resource may be the <em>target</em> of a notification. By target, we mean a notification may be addressed <em>to</em> the resource, be <em>about</em> the resource, or for a sender to otherwise decide that it is appropriate to draw the attention of the resource (or resource owner) to the information in the notification body. As such, any Web resource must be able to advertise an endpoint to which it can receive notifications. Resources can be RDF or non-RDF (such as an image, or CSV dataset), and may be informational (a blog post, a user profile) or non-informational (a person).</p>

                  <p id='notification-body'><strong>Notification body</strong> (<a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#notification-body'>R4-B</a>): We consider the <em>contents</em> of a notification to be application specific because different domains have different needs. From a sender\u2019s perspective, we permit a notification to contain <em>any data</em>, and a notification can use <em>any vocabulary</em>. From a consumer\u2019s perspective, interoperability between different applications occurs through vocabulary reuse, and shared understanding of terms. This is in accordance with Linked Data principles in general. The practical upshot of this is that a calendar application which consumes event invitations using the <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfcal/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212251/https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfcal/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:51Z'>RDF Calendar</a></cite> vocabulary is likely to completely ignore notifications containing the <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212209/https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:09Z'>PROV Ontology</a></cite>, even if it finds them all stored in the same place. For two independent applications operating in the <em>same</em> domain, a shared understanding of appropriate vocabulary terms is assumed.</p>

                  <p id='notification-verification'><strong>Notification verification</strong> (<a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#notification-verification'>R4-C</a>): From a receiver\u2019s perspective, exposing itself to receive any blobs of RDF data from unknown senders may be problematic. Thus, it should be possible for the receiver to enforce restrictions and accept only notifications that are acceptable according to its own criteria (deemed by eg. user configuration; domain-specific receivers). This can be used as an anti-spam measure, a security protection, or for attaining application and data integrity.</p>

                  <p id='subscribing'><strong>Subscribing</strong> (<a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#subscribing'>R5</a>): In general, applications may require that new notifications are pushed to them in real-time, or to request them at appropriate intervals. To take this into account, we expand our definition of senders, receivers and consumers with the following interaction expectations: notifications are <em>pushed</em> from senders to receivers; and <em>pulled</em> from receivers by consumers.</p>

LDN describes how servers (receivers) can receive messages pushed to them by applications (senders), as well as how other applications (consumers) may retrieve those messages. Any resource (target) can advertise a receiving endpoint (Inbox) for notification messages. Messages are expressed in RDF, and can contain arbitrary data. LDN is a <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709211912/https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:19:12Z'>W3C Recommendation</a></cite>.</p>

                  <p id='design-intent'>We designed the LDN protocol to support sharing and reuse of notifications <em>across</em> applications, regardless of how they were generated or what their contents are. I describe how the principles of identification, addressability and semantic representation can be applied to notifications on the Web. Specifying LDN as a formal protocol allows independently implemented, heterogeneous applications which generate and use notifications, to seamlessly work together. Thus, LDN supports the decentralisation of the Web as well as encourages the generation and consumption of Linked Data.</p>

                  <p id='design-decision'>LDN is built on existing W3C standards and Linked Data principles. In particular, the storage of notifications is compatible with the <cite>Linked Data Platform</cite> specification; notifications are identified by HTTP URIs; and notification contents are available as JSON-LD (or other RDF syntaxes as per content-negotiation). A key architectural decision is the separation of concerns between <em>senders</em>, <em>receivers</em>, and <em>consumers</em> of notifications. Implementations of the protocol can play one or more of these roles, and interoperate successfully with implementations playing the complementary roles. This means that notifications generated by one application can be reused by a completely different application, accessed via the store where the notification data resides, through shared Linked Data vocabularies. LDN also pushes the decentralised approach further by allowing any <em>target</em> resource to advertise its Inbox anywhere on the Web; that is, targets do not need to be coupled with or controlled by a receiver operating from the same server, and can make use of a third-party <em>inbox-as-a-service</em>.</p>

                  <p>Beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia, LDN senders and consumers need little to no prior knowledge about how to interact with receivers. Furthermore, senders and consumers determine a target\u2019s inbox location dynamically. This design approach is aligned with the notion of <a href='#self-describing'>self-describing resources</a> in that applications are only required to identify a particular relation indicating the inbox location, and perform a <cite><a href='#follow-your-nose'>follow your nose</a></cite> type of exploration. Given that a target\u2019s preferred inbox location may change at their discretion, applications can be adaptive in inbox discovery.</p>

                      <p>The data formats which are used by a notification specification must be chosen to maximise interoperability between implementations. <cite>Structure of Scholarly Information</cite> makes the argument for using <a href='#rdf-as-the-language'>RDF as the language</a> to express human- and machine-readable information on the Web. Allowing LDN actors \u2013 senders, receivers, and consumers \u2013 to handle data irrespective of the particular RDF serialisation permits flexibility, however it can also be costly to support. We take into account:</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li><em>Application interoperability</em> eg. should applications support all current RDF formats, as well as new versions or formats in the future?</li>
                        <li><em>Maintenance of RDF parsers and serialisation libraries</em> eg. will the RDF libraries that applications use be kept up to date?</li>
                        <li><em>Complexity of their inclusion in applications</em> eg. what are the costs or concerns of using all RDF formats?</li>
                        <li><em>Run-time efficiency</em> eg. how well will applications perform going forward?</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p><strong>Why JSON-LD</strong>: To address these issues, choosing a single RDF serialisation to <em>require</em> is necessary for consistent interoperability, as well as keeping processing requirements or external code dependencies minimal. While any RDF notation would satisfy that need, we decided that LDN requires all applications to create and understand the JSON-LD syntax, both for the contents of Inbox as well as for individual notifications.</p>

                      <p>To some extent, JSON-LD is compatible with existing JSON libraries or in some cases native programming language data structures. For example, Web browsers have a built-in interpreter for JavaScript that can handle JSON objects, that can take advantage of native object operations. Same data processing and manipulation operations are also available in a Node.js environment. Having said that, JSON-LD is a format that serves to be an RDF notation, and can also be processed as plain JSON. Hence, JSON-LD is just one convenience to certain kinds of environments that the application is confined to. JSON-LD is also advantageous in being familiar for developers who are <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='http://manu.sporny.org/2014/json-ld-origins-2/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190405035404/http://manu.sporny.org/2014/json-ld-origins-2/' data-versiondate='2019-04-05T03:54:04Z'>used to JSON-based APIs but not RDF</a></cite>.</p>

                      <p><strong>Content negotiation</strong>: Optionally, applications may attempt to exchange different RDF serialisations by performing <strong>content negotiation</strong>. As in compliance with HTTP principles, a sender may make an <code>HTTP OPTIONS</code> request to the receiver to determine the RDF content types accepted by the server. A receiver can expose <code>Accept-Post</code> headers for senders, and so the sender can serialize the notification in the request body accordingly. Consumers can send <code>Accept</code> headers to receivers to signal which RDF content types they prefer and capable of processing.</p>

                      <p>By mandating one RDF syntax (JSON-LD) for applications to communicate with, as well as permitting other syntaxes to discover and exchange notifications, compatibility across applications is assured.</p>

                      <p id='target-ownership'><strong>Target ownership</strong>: As per AWWW\u2019s <cite>URI Ownership</cite>, the Inbox is ultimately controlled by the owner of LDN Receiver, and subject to third-party access to HTTP headers and content. Hence, publishers of the resources advertising an Inbox (target) are expected to be aware of using servers they trust or control for the Inbox location.</p>

                      <p id='constraints'><strong>Constraints</strong>: One way to filter unwarranted notifications from being created on the server and exposed is where Inbox URLs announce their own constraints eg. <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212253/https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:53Z'>Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)</a></cite>, <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://shexspec.github.io/spec/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212253/https://shexspec.github.io/spec/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:53Z'>ShEx</a></cite>, Web Annotation Protocol, via an HTTP <code>Link</code> header or body of the resource with a <code>rel</code> value of <code>ldp:constrainedBy</code>. For example, an LDN receiver may want to allow notifications with a certain shape; a model specifying allowed and required values in a notification. This is so that senders can comply with the advertised constraint specification or the receiver may reject their notification. Rejecting notifications which do not match a specific pattern in their contents, or the <em>shape</em> of the data, is one way to filter. For example, if the Inbox owner knows that they will only ever use a consuming application which processes friend requests, they can configure their receiver to filter out anything that does not match the pattern for a friend request, helping their consumer to be more efficient. If the notification constraints are also advertised by the receiving service as structured descriptions, generation and consumption of the notifications can be further automated. Constraints are particularly useful towards providing notifications that meets a certain criteria so that it can be used effectively by consuming applications.</p>

                      <p id='authenticated-inboxes'><strong>Authenticated inboxes</strong>: The requirement for reusable notifications could be seen as a potential risk for privacy. The LDN Receivers are expected to consider implementing access control on the Inbox URL as well as the individual notification URL and may restrict reading and writing to a whitelist of trusted senders. Various authentication methods which could be used alongside LDN with the idea that notifications are not necessarily public but only visible or reusable by intended parties. The receivers decide (based on their use case) which consumers (based on any criteria) can reuse. They achieve this by setting authentication and authorization settings on the notifications. As  different authentication mechanisms are appropriate for different applications, the notification protocol should ideally be usable alongside various methods such as clientside certificates, eg. WebID+TLS, token-based, eg. OAuth 2.0, or digital signatures.</p>

                      <p id='personally-identifiable-information'><strong>Personally identifiable information</strong>: Notification payloads may contain any data including that which identifies the sender or the receiver. As access to the Inbox and notification data is under the control of the receiver, they ultimately determine what information may be exposed to the world. Once fetched by a third-party, any piece of information could potentially be subject to further (unauthorised) distribution and reuse. Hence, this is orthogonal to whether the notifications are ephemeral or persistent.</p>

                <h3 property='schema:name'>Test Suite and Implementation Reports</h3>
                <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                  <p>The W3C <q>Technical Reports</q> are intended to help different (current or future) implementations to have common core functionality and quality, comply with accessibility and internationalisation guidelines, and take security and privacy considerations into account. When an application, for instance, implements a specification, it can be checked against that specification\u2019s conformance criteria for normative requirements. Specifications are typically accompanied with test suites to assist implementations to identify their conformance level as well as areas for improvement. Similarly, reports and feedback help specifications to improve and advance towards publication. So, specifications and conforming implementations are integral to ensuring interoperable applications.</p>

                  <p>As a concrete example of the benefits of resource-centric notifications, I took the liberty to both use the W3C process of creating a test suite for LDN, and the submission of reports about implementations to exemplify the LDN protocol itself, as well as to generate discoverable Linked Data about the specification and its implementations. The LDN <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212253/https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:53Z'>test suite</a></cite> is itself an LDN implementation for the purpose of automating the collection and aggregation of implementation reports which were used directly towards the formal standardisation process.</p>

                  <p>The LDN test suite covers each requirement of the specification with individual tests, and the test suite documentation is semantically linked with the specification itself accordingly. Once the tests have been run, the test suite generates a similarly linked implementation report. This report is submitted using LDN itself as the notification mechanism. The listing of implementation reports (software conforming to the specification) is automatically updated and are accessible as their own registered units of information.</p>


                  <p id='ldn-test-suites'>The LDN test suite puts the LDN protocol into practice by acting as an LDN receiver implementation (based on <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://github.com/csarven/mayktso' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212253/https://github.com/csarven/mayktso' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:53Z'>mayktso</a></cite>). It also acts as a sender and consumer LDN implementation. Each part of the test suite (for <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/sender'>Senders</a>, <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/receiver'>Receivers</a>, and <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/consumer'>Consumers</a>) advertise an <code>ldp:inbox</code>. Upon completion of a run of the tests, the system generates the report data and sends an LDN notification to the Inbox. The payload of the notification is the full report as RDF.</p>

                  <p id='ldn-consumers'>As an LDN Consumer, the test suite generates the <a href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/summary'>summary</a> of the reports by fetching and processing Inbox contents. The notifications are aggregated automatically, and the semantics of the submitted reports are retained.</p>

                  <p>The services are decoupled; that is, an implementer may generate their report independently of the test suite, and submit it via the standard LDN protocol. Furthermore, projects can implement their own consumers and reuse the report data generated by the test suite directly, for example to demonstrate to potential users their conformance to the LDN specification.</p>

                  <p>All reports have their own URLs, and a human-readable representation in HTML+RDFa, in addition to JSON-LD or other RDF syntax per <code>HTTP OPTIONS</code> and <code>Accept-Post</code> negotiation at this particular test server. See for example <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://dokie.li/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212253/https://dokie.li/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:53Z'>dokieli</a></cite>\u2019s <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/reports/2c5af2f0-f832-11e6-a642-0dd857219753'>implementation report and test results</a> as a sender. This provides the human-visible information, eg. what was tested and the results also in machine-readable form. The report can be seen as a dataset composed of observations based on the structure that was specified in the specification. Hence, each test report is a <code>qb:DataSet</code> (and generally equivalent in <code>as:Object</code>) where its <code>qb:structure</code> refers to <code>https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/#data-structure-definition</code>. The dataset has <code>as:published</code> and <code>as:actor</code> for the agent that initiated the test and generated the report. The report may be accompanied with an additional <code>as:summary</code>.

                  <p>The implementation test report has some basic information linking to the <code>doap:Project</code> with a <code>doap:name</code>, and its <code>doap:maintainer</code>.</p>

                  <p>All of the sender, receiver, and consumer reports are available in separate aggregate tables in <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/summary' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212254/https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/summary' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:54Z'>LDN Tests Summary</a></cite>.

For instance, implementations range from minimum proof of concepts like DIY Inbox to enterprise-ready platforms like Apache Marmotta or Virtuoso Universal Server. <cite><a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://dr.amy.gy/chapter5#building-pwo' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212255/https://dr.amy.gy/chapter5' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:55Z'>Sloph</a></cite>, <cite>The Presentation of Self on a Decentralised Web</cite>, Guy, 2017, and IndieAnndroid are part of personal publishing and quantified self platforms geared around social media-like interactions.

                      <p>Some of the sender implementations include streaming-capable implementations of LDN, stand-alone libraries, and domain specific applications. Some of the sender implementations also fulfill the role of a consumer. For instance, Linked Edit Rules checks the consistency of statistical datasets against structured constraints, and delivers the consistency report as a notification to the user. py-ldnlib is a library that can be reused by other applications to send LDN notifications.</p>

                <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                  <p>This section goes into detail about how LDN fulfills or supports some of the forces and functions in scientific communication. LDN can facilitate the realisation of interconnecting scholarly communication systems as posited in <cite>Rethinking Scholarly Communication</cite>.</p>

                  <p id='ldn-forces'>Assuming multiple interoperating implementations of LDN, I observe the <em>forces</em>:</p>

                  <dl>
                    <dt>Actors</dt>
                    <dd>The actors involved in executing the LDN protocol can be categorised into documents (or things, or entities) and software applications. An LDN target (like a document or a researcher profile) with an inbox is the actor that affords the start of any communication. Applications consist of LDN implementations with one or more roles: sender, receiver, and consumer, with the purpose of delivering information to or about a target that can be used by interested parties.</dd>

                    <dt>Content</dt>
                    <dd>Target resources, inboxes, and notifications collectively comprise the content in LDN\u2019s flow. That is, any target resource advertising an inbox relation; an inbox description with a collection of notifications (with optional data about creating and using notifications), and individual notifications with any RDF contents. A notification\u2019s content can include or refer to any unit of information or communication in the scientific and scholarly system.</dd>

                    <dt>Accessibility</dt>
                    <dd>An inbox and its notifications are made <em>available</em> to users and applications via HTTP over a network connection. When an HTTP URL resolves, its contents are <em>retrievable</em>, subject to authentication and authorization. Content can be created by and made available to different kinds of consumers: humans or machines.</dd>

                    <dt>Applicability</dt>
                    <dd>Applicability of scholarly communication comes from research which responds to problems or answers questions, which can be used or built upon by others. Notifications enable communication between different parties (individuals, universities, research institutions, industry, etc.) and LDN enables more direct, non-centralised control over this communication.</dd>
                  </dl>

                  <p id='ldn-functions'>The <em>functions</em>:</p>

                  <dl>
                    <dt>Registration</dt>
                    <dd>Prior to LDN, notifications generally would not be considered as persistent units of information. Notifications being registered as their own entities as HTTP URIs facilitates information discovery and reuse. Registration of scholarly artifacts are not addressed by LDN, however, notifications which reference scholarly artifacts are registered.</dd>

                    <dt>Awareness</dt>
                    <dd>The LDN protocol provides a way for content to be disseminated, as well as read by different consumers. LDN can be used to inform systems that a registration of a unit of information took place; a request for quality-control and verification is sought-after, or has occurred; and for instance, an archiving service is informed to place a request for preserving the units.</dd>

                    <dt>Certification</dt>
                    <dd>LDN can be implemented to support scholarly certification mechanisms. Notifications can be sent to request review, as well to return the results of a certification process such as a registered unit of information\u2019s significance and soundness. Units of information at any level of granularity can be referenced in notifications, from entire articles to individual data points. Similarly, information about a revocation of a unit of information can be circulated.</dd>

                    <dt>Archiving</dt>
                    <dd>LDN can be implemented to support archival processes. When new units of information are registered, or existing units of information are updated, archives can be notified in order to store a persistent copy of the resources.</dd>

                <h3 property='schema:name'>Contextualising LDN</h3>
                <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                  <p>I have discussed how notifications may be purposed in a number of ways in a decentralised scholarly communication ecosystem. In addition, outlined specific use cases, and used these to derive design considerations. An overview of existing protocols for decentralised notifications indicates their respective strengths and shortcomings, and a new protocol is designed to meet our needs in light of this. The Linked Data Notifications protocol separates the concepts of <em>senders</em>, <em>receivers</em> and <em>consumers</em> of notifications for modularity and leverages Linked Data concepts of shared vocabularies and URIs, thus providing a building block for notifications between diverse decentralised and loosely coupled Web applications. The three roles can be implemented independently from each other or all together in one system. This permits end users more freedom to switch between the online tools they use, as well as generating greater value when notifications from different sources can be shared between applications and used in combination.</p>

                  <p>The utility and flexibility of LDN is demonstrated to some extent by the various implementations reported as part of the standardisation process. In this final concluding section, I evaluate LDN by comparing it along various axes with the potential alternatives. I also explain its relationship with other Web standards in the Linked Data or decentralisation space, and describe how LDN addresses users\u2019 degree of control over their data and applications. Finally, I discuss additional considerations that were omitted from LDN at the time of standardisation but may be important to take into account for certain implementations.</p>

                      </figure>

                      <p>All of the notification mechanisms specify multiple roles, with the Sender (S) being common across all of them. LDN is the only mechanism which describes the Consumer (C) role; this explicitly highlights how notifications can be useful to applications other than those concerned with sending and receiving. For mechanisms which include a Subscriber (U) role, the Receiver (R) is essentially also the Consumer, so Receivers are less generic and require specialised payloads. In this respect, LDN is a more modular specification. LDN Receivers need not be concerned with additional actions beyond storing and exposing notifications; complex and domain-specific uses of the notifications are left to Consumers, resulting in a lot more flexibility in terms of lightweight end-user applications.</p>

                      <p>WebSub differs in terms of the number of roles, but not the actual functions of the specified roles. The hub is an intermediate party which plays the role of a Receiver and a Sender, relaying notifications from the original Sender (or publisher) to the Subscriber (or ultimate Receiver), but nonetheless only makes notifications available to the Subscriber and no other applications.</p>

                      <p>LDN enforces that notifications should be reusable, and specifies how Receivers should make notifications available for Consumers. The other mechanisms either consider notification reuse as inapplicable or leave it optional and unspecified.</p>

                      <p>This is also tied to to persistence and retrievability in that LDN requires notifications to be identified by dereferenceable HTTP URIs. The other notification mechanisms treat notifications as ephemeral resources which only exist until they are delivered to a Receiver.</p>

                      <p>The mechanisms with the <em>fat ping</em> approach require structured data in XML or JSON-LD. Only LDN requires the use of RDF through JSON-LD, and optional content negotiation for other RDF syntaxes. Thus, notification payloads can include references to other retrievable resources, or can embed all relevant data directly in the payload.</p>

                      <p>Approaches which send only URLs (as with linkback) rely on the receiver interpreting a third-party resource, which may or may not contain structured content or be under the control of the sender. Approaches which offer additional guidance to aid the receiver in interpreting the source document(s) nonetheless still restrict the sender. LDN therefore offers flexibility to senders, increasing the potential uses for the notification mechanism. LDN compensates for increased complexity on the receiver\u2019s end by recommending filtering mechanisms, and moving most of the burden of understanding notification contents to the consumer role. In placing no constraints on the notification payload, LDN enables a sender to be precise and lossless with the data it is transmitting. As such LDN can cover a broader variety of use cases.</p>

                      <p>LDN recommends that Receiver applications perform some processing of the payload. This is to enable users to configure their Receivers to filter out spam or customise them for particular domains, but is not required; such filtering could also be left to or supplemented by Consumers. In contrast, Semantic Pingback and Webmention require receivers to parse the form-encoded payload and then to perform fetching of the URLs within and additional parsing of the documents those URLs identify. This is required in order to verify the message (by finding the target URL). Such processing in LDN is left at the discretion of the Receiver; linkback style verification is not required, but also not forbidden. </p>

                      <p>As WebSub requires subscribing as part of its core design, hubs are expected to perform specific actions on receipt of a <em>subscription</em> request (where the payload is tightly constrained), but not necessarily to process the contents of a notification sent by a <em>publisher</em> (where the payload can be anything; how they handle this depends on the content-type). </p>

                      <p>Though LDN does not specify a subscription mechanism in the same vein as WebSub, thanks to the modularity of specification conformance classes and the flexible nature of the notification contents, it is possible for applications to perform subscription-like interaction by taking on multiple roles.</p>

                      <p>LDN requires that Senders and Consumers are equipped to discover Inboxes (receiving endpoints) through both HTTP headers and the body of an RDF resource. This slightly increased complexity around Inbox discovery for Senders and Consumers is a worthwhile tradeoff to lower the bar for publishers of target resources; Inboxes can be advertised from <em>any</em> document on the Web (through HTTP headers), and attached to even non-informational resources (through RDF statements). This increases the potential use cases for LDN.</p>

                      <p>It is difficult to objectively measure performance metrics of different mechanisms as the various implementations use different servers and programming languages whose efficiency do not necessarily have any bearing on the protocols themselves. Mechanisms which require large payloads may increase the time for HTTP requests to be processed, and mechanisms that require verification add an additional network request to complete the process.</p>

                      <p>There are several technical specifications that LDN may be interoperably combined. Here I discuss a few.</p>

LDP <a rel='cito:citesAsRelated' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/#ldpc-general'>does not define</a> how clients discover LDP Containers. Through LDN\u2019s inbox discovery, LDP Containers for the purpose of holding notifications can be discovered. Thus, the core features necessary to exchange notifications between LDN applications is effectively possible with existing, as well as future implementations of LDP.</p>

                      <p id='relationship-with-activitypub'><strong>Relationship with ActivityPub</strong>: ActivityPub uses LDN\u2019s <a rel='cito:citesAsRelated' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#inbox'>targeting</a> and <a rel='cito:citesAsRelated' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#delivery'>delivery</a> mechanism with <a rel='cito:citesAsRelated' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#ldn-relationship'>some specific constraints</a>. Notifications must use a single AS2 Activity in compact JSON-LD syntax. Receivers are required to authenticate requests made by Senders, as well as verify the existence of an object (that the activity is about) that is mentioned in the notification by fetching its source from the origin server. It is possible for LDN Senders to deliver notifications to AP servers. It is also possible for AP clients to deliver messages to LDN Receivers with some bridging.</p>

                      <p id='relationship-with-fedora'><strong>Relationship with Fedora API</strong>: The <a rel='cito:citesAsRelated' href='http://fcrepo.github.io/fcrepo-specification/'>Fedora API Specification</a> is in the process of being formalised (as an extension of LDP) by the Fedora community. As LDN can be used to support external integrations, Fedora API\u2019s repository event stream <a rel='cito:citesAsRelated' href='https://fcrepo.github.io/fcrepo-specification/#notifications'>draws upon the LDN specification</a>, allowing LDN consumers and senders to react asynchronously to repository events. Fedora implementations were included in the LDN implementation reports.</p>

                      <p id='linked-data-vocabularies'><strong>Linked Data vocabularies</strong>: As LDN is agnostic about the contents of a notification, any Linked Data vocabulary can be used, including the <cite><a href='#vocabularies'>Vocabularies</a></cite> I have previously discussed in <cite><a href='#structure-of-scholarly-information'>Structure of Scholarly Information</a></cite>.</p>

                      <p id='federation-protocols'><strong>Relationship with other federation protocols</strong>: Further similarities and differences between LDN and other federation protocols and social APIs are described in W3C Note <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/social-web-protocols/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212256/https://www.w3.org/TR/social-web-protocols/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:56Z'>Social Web Protocols</a></cite>.

                      <p>At the beginning of this section, four requirements relating to <cite><a href='#degree-of-control'>Degree of Control</a></cite> were listed. LDN addresses each of these as follows:</p>

                        <dt>Actors can use their preferred applications to discover, reuse, and send notifications</dt>
                        <dd>LDN was developed as a W3C standard, with strict criteria for interoperability. Applications which implement any of the roles of the protocol can confirm their conformance with the test suite, and are thus expected to be able to interoperate with other conformant applications. Actors should be able to choose any available conformant application and maintain expected notification-related functionality.</dd>

                        <dt>Users store incoming notifications where they prefer</dt>
                        <dd>Any conforming LDN Receiver (server) under a particular user\u2019s control \u2013 which they trust, and are authorised to read \u2013 can be chosen to store notifications.</dd>

                        <dd>LDN specifies the mechanism for information exchange, so it is possible to switch between Receiver applications at the protocol level without any further action (implementation-specific details like database storage mechanism may require additional work for portability of data already stored there; this is out of scope of the LDN specification). A user\u2019s Receiver, where notification data is stored, has no bearing on their ability to alternate between sending and consuming applications as needed.</dd>

In this case, the target resource\u2019s inbox location would simply point to the new location. As inbox discovery starts from looking up a target resource\u2019s description, the new inbox location will be discovered as before.</dd>

                    </div>

                    <h4 property='schema:name'>Additional Considerations</h4>
                    <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                      <p>The LDN specification itself covers privacy and security considerations on <cite><a href='#authenticated-inboxes'>authenticated inboxes</a></cite> and <cite><a href='#personally-identifiable-information'>personally identifiable information</a></cite>. As for <a href='#persistence-and-retrievability'>persistence and retrievability</a>, any consumer application can potentially benefit from being able to reuse notifications if the owners of a receiver makes the necessary commitments. There are further considerations which may be of interest to implementers, or may constitute future work around extending the core protocol, which are worth outlining here.</p>

                      <p id='subscribing-to-notifications'><strong>Subscribing to Notifications</strong>: The interaction between consumers and receivers describes a <em>pull</em> mechanism. A <cite><a href='#subscribing'>subscribing</a></cite> mechanism in which consumers <em>request</em> that receivers <em>push</em> content changes to them is left out of scope. Much of the related work <em>requires</em> notifications to be explicitly solicited to trigger sending. Since in a decentralised model, receivers may not be aware of possible sources for notifications, our sender-receiver relationship depends on the sender\u2019s autonomy to make such decisions by itself. This does not preclude the scenario in which a receiver may wish to solicit notifications from a particular sender, but as there are already <em>subscription</em> mechanisms in wide use on the Web eg. ActivityPub, WebSub, <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212256/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:56Z'>The WebSocket Protocol</a></cite> (<abbr title='The WebSocket Protocol'>RFC 6455</abbr>), <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8030' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212256/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8030' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:56Z'>Generic Event Delivery Using HTTP Push</a></cite> (<abbr title='Generic Event Delivery Using HTTP Push'>RFC 8030</abbr>), and can be interoperably combined with LDN, we do not need to specify it as part of our protocol. A push based interaction can still be arranged between LDN applications, where it would be implementation specific. For example, in a notification, a sender specifies the location of an inbox where it can receive updates about content changes. Then, an application that consumes the notifications manages its own subscriber list, and takes the role of sender in order to push content to the inbox as specified in the notification. Another specification-level integration of LDN pertaining to subscribing is that ActivityPub\u2019s <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#follow-activity-inbox' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212236/https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:36Z'>Follow Activity</a></cite> is a notification requesting to be notified of target\u2019s activities when they are created. Once the request is approved, the requesting actor is added to target actor\u2019s <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#followers' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212236/https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:36Z'>Followers Collection</a></cite> \u2013 a list of actors (with their own inboxes). The server then dispatches notifications to the inboxes of these actors.</p>

                      <p id='semantic-organisation-of-notifications'><strong>Semantic Organisation of Notifications</strong>: While LDN facilitates a decentralised architecture for notification exchange, it does not prescribe the structure and semantics of the notifications themselves. The composition of the notifications are unspecified to foster different kinds of applications to be built to communicate information in any domain. Consequently, organisation of notification models materialises through the fact that domain-centric applications create and consume what is meaningful to them in order to coordinate among themselves. So while the notification system is globally decentralised, it enables communication that can be specialised and be only useful and meaningful to applications that understands a particular message\u2019s semantics.</p>

                      <p id='inbox-paging'><strong>Inbox Paging</strong>: We need to consider both the needs of software systems and humans when large amounts of notification data are being generated and shared between diverse applications which may be operating without knowledge of each other. To organise and manage large amount of notifications over time, mechanisms should be in place to break representations of collections of notifications into multiple paged responses that may be easier to consume by applications.</p>

                      <p id='updating-and-deleting-notifications'><strong>Updating and Deleting Notifications</strong>: Receivers may want to carry out resource management or garbage collection, or permit consumers or other applications to do so. For example, an application to consume messages might let an authenticated and authorised user \u2018mark as read\u2019 by adding a triple to the inbox or notification contents.</p>

                      <p id='social-implications'><strong>Social Implications</strong>: In an ecosystem where anyone can (technically) say anything about anything, we can acknowledge the social challenges surrounding that in context of notifications. As the LDN protocol facilitates distribution and discovery of information, it can amplify misinformation and (community-centric) inappropriate content, as well as online and offline social dangers effectively. That is, consumers of notifications can be exposed to such information if an inbox is not managed properly. LDN may offer one way to mitigate this problem in that, the actors that control an inbox can decide on which notifications can persist and which to be removed, thereby one way to eliminate references to undesirable content created by other parties. At the same time, the same privilege can also be used to filter information and have bias towards certain parties. This is a form of decentralised curation in that while no single inbox can oversee the discovery of a resource (as there are alternative ways), it enables the owners of receivers to exert their authority on the notifications that makes it into their system. It is a middle-ground in that, on one hand, individuals can voice themselves by registering and making their resources accessible, owners of inboxes can choose not to provide pointers to it. I will further revisit some of these concerns in <cite><a href='#addressing-social-implications'>Addressing Social Implications</a></cite>.</p>

                  <p>As we have seen in <cite>Scholarly Communication on the Web</cite>, research communication is continuously transitioning from print-centric to Web-centric. LDN being rooted to Web-centric protocols and formats builds on a reliable and relevant foundation for it to be used as part of the future scholarly communications ecosystem.</p>

                  <p>There are many diverse use cases for notifications within scholarly communication now and likely to be more in the future, so designing the protocol to be flexible permits a common thread of data sharing between these different cases, as well as accommodating unexpected use. Specialisation may be necessary for notifications to be particularly useful in a lot of scenarios, however the protocol is not the level to do this. Thus, LDN leaves it up to applications to specialise their functionality for particular domains or user needs by using semantically <cite><a href='#self-describing'>self-descriptive</a></cite> notifications.</p>

                  <p>In the next section, I present LDN as one part of the broader scholarly communication ecosystem through an implementation which ties together many relevant protocols, and encompasses article authoring, annotations, and social interactions.</p>

              <p>Academic articles are commonly represented in packages, like binary file formats (PDF, Word) merging structural, presentational, and behavioural layers. Such forms are often disconnected from other knowledge, in that navigation from one unit of information to another is non-continuous or not uniformly accessible and usable by both human and machine users. This is generally due to historical policy, cost, and social or technical reasons intertwined with the systems around units of scholarly communication. One side-effect of scholarly publication still being primarily driven by the constraints of print media in this way is that it is challenging for efficient machine-readable coordination on the Web, as well as for continuous advancement of creating, communicating, and consuming information as part of the Open Web Platform.</p>

              <p>I have covered existing initiatives and progress in research, standards, and practices towards different aspects of realising a decentralised information space. Each dataspace can be individually controlled with access controls for participating agents. Different applications can be implemented to operate on the same data, as well as send activities about the interactions with the data.</p>

              <p>The implementation of dokieli is a core contribution of this thesis, and serves as a culmination of the various background research, Web standards work, and advocacy I have done so far. It is an implementation which showcases various disparate parts \u2013 Web standards, technologies, and social ideals \u2013 coming together in a cohesive way to serve a future scholarly communication ecosystem which takes full advantage of the capabilities of the Web.</p>

              <p>dokieli is not intended to be <em>the</em> solution for decentralised academic publishing and communication. My contribution is not the implementation itself, but rather the deep exploration and demonstration of how the, often complex and controversial, moving parts of the scholarly communications ecosystem can come together. What is presented here is a description of the state of the work at the time of writing. It is intended as a conceptual guide or model, and a minimum-viable baseline to be bettered by future developers and researchers. Certain development decisions were made based on existing literature, development, and observations in the relevant fields, which are discussed throughout the prior sections of this thesis. The major undertaking here was to develop dokieli with a thorough analysis of the technical possibilities of the Web <em>as well as</em> the social context in which academic researchers currently find themselves. This is not a quick-fix or a patch, but an ongoing and lengthy iterative process. It is my hope that future tooling built to support the forces and functions in decentralised scholarly communication can build upon the rationale for the ways in which dokieli is designed, and learn from the things that work and the things that do not.</p>

                  <p>By using different arrangements of LDN, WA, AP, LDP mechanisms and as well as relevant Linked Data vocabularies, scholarly and social activities can be systematically created, linked, discovered, and reused for a variety of use cases. In this section, I present an overview of <em>a</em> decentralised information space including actor profiles, notifications, and annotations. As units of information are structured and semantically interconnected, it forms a knowledge graph with the following key components with respect to technical specifications and practices:</p>

                  <p>When discussing discovery throughout this section, this means the <cite><a href='#follow-your-nose'>follow your nose</a></cite> approach of using the kinds of links listed above to find relevant services and other resources. Applications can incrementally arrange and implement a combination of these components to deliver and discover distributed activities on the Web \u2013 in a similar fashion to the <cite><a href='#paygo'>paygo</a></cite> approach. For example, the preferred locations for data storage, annotations and notifications for resources can be used as input to create new resources eg. assigning an inbox for an annotation where the inbox location is derived from a profile\u2019s preferred location for a class of information. Thereby a chain of operations can be orchestrated for decentralised units of information. This matches the notion of decoupled functions and reconstructing information flows for a unit of communication as posited in <cite><a href='#rethinking-scholarly-communication'>Rethinking Scholarly Communication</a></cite>.</p>

                  <p>dokieli is a general-purpose clientside editor for decentralised article publishing, annotations and social interactions. While it implements use cases specific to research or scholarly communication, it is not constrained to any knowledge domain or field of work. For instance, dokieli is capable of rendering the following use cases from the W3C <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709111137/https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T11:11:37Z'>RDFa Use Cases: Scenarios for Embedding RDF in HTML</a></cite>: <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-1'>Basic Structured Blogging</q>, <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-2'>Publishing an Event - Overriding Some of the Rendered Data</q>, <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-3'>Content Management Metadata</q>, <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-5'>Web Clipboard</q>, <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-7'>Advanced Data Structures</q>, and <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-8'>Augmented Browsing for Scientists</q>, <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-9'>Publishing a RDF Vocabulary</q>.

                  <p>dokieli uses <cite><a href='#linked-data-notifications'>LDN</a></cite> to send and consume notifications. For example, when a reader comments on a fragment of text in an article, the application discovers the article\u2019s Inbox and sends a notification about the annotation. dokieli also consumes notifications from this Inbox to fetch and display the annotation as marginalia (<a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='#figure-dokieli-annotation'>figure dokieli Web Annotation</a>), or indicates the back-references as in the case with citations. A reader can share a dokieli-enabled article with their contacts; dokieli discovers each contact\u2019s Inbox and sends a notification there (<a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='#figure-dokieli-share'>figure dokieli Share</a>). When editing an article, the author can add a citation. If an Inbox is discovered in the cited article, dokieli sends a notification there to indicate what part of the article was cited by whom and where. dokieli-enabled articles also consume citation notifications to display these metrics for the author and other readers (<a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='#figure-dokieli-citation'>figure dokieli Citations and Notifications</a>).</p>

                  <p>Next I describe dokieli\u2019s architecture according to the following capabilities:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Actors use their own WebIDs to identify themselves with, and use their profile information to adapt the user interface.</li>
                    <li>Actors publish and consume human- and machine-readable Linked Data, and decide where they are made available from and the conditions for access and reuse.</li>
                    <li>Actors trigger the notification system to announce, as well as discover relevant information.</li>
                  </ul>

The content representation in HTML+RDFa that dokieli produces is accessible (readable by human and machine consumers) without requiring CSS or JavaScript, ie. text-browser safe, as well as backwards-compatible with the <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212259/https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:59Z'>WorldWideWeb</a></cite> browser.</span></p>

That is, machine-readable semantics are embedded directly into human-visible prose through RDFa. dokieli applies this technique to avoid data duplication in the same document \u2013 adhering to the <abbr title='Don\u2019t Repeat Yourself'>DRY</abbr> principle. The approach also helps to avoid the creation and usage of multiple data islands, ie. separately for humans and machines. Consequently, it has the advantage of not having any dependency on JavaScript in order to make the hidden machine-readable content be consumable from a human user interface. One exception to this rule is where dokieli allows authors to embed Turtle, JSON-LD, or TriG data blocks (useful for Nanopublications) in HTML typically for the purpose of including complementary non-prose structured information. We cannot know in advance what new kinds of information or data can be integrated into articles, so to facilitate extensibility, dokieli sets no constraints on what information can be embedded nor how it can be be expressed. Hence, information can be expressed using different vocabularies, enabling reuse of existing data models and the addition of new semantic expressions.</span></p>

All articles, annotations, and notifications can be assembled in various combinations since they are ultimately expressed using the RDF language, which acts as a layer to describe them at any level of abstraction. All units of information in articles, annotations, and notifications are self-contained, context neutral, globally identifiable and accessible without additional processing. Resources can be versioned, marked as immutable, and archived, thereby treating them as stateless entities on the Web. Another way to reuse the resources is by dynamically embedding them in articles while communicating the original context eg. link to the source, parameters in which an annotation was created. Notifications can serve to establish <span id='bi-directional-linking'>bi-directional linking</span> eg. in citations. Articles and annotations can embed media objects eg. images, videos, audio, or documents, as reusable resources.</span></p>

                      <p>Before dokieli makes a write request to a server, it triggers content-negotiation through <code>HTTP OPTIONS</code> and checks for <code>Allow</code> and <code>Accept-Post</code> HTTP headers in order to determine server\u2019s preferences. In the absence of successful negotiation, dokieli proceeds to make the request as per the required parameters of LDN, WAP and AP. For example, <code>HTTP POST</code> with <code>application/ld+json</code> content type would be used for annotations and notifications, if a server\u2019s preference is not determined.</p>

                      <p>Articles are by default use HTML with embedded RDFa. Where a server implements <code>HTTP GET</code> with <code>text/html</code>, and allows <code>HTTP PUT</code> for writing, the assumption is that it can allow payloads with <code>text/html</code> content type. HTML+RDFa is considered to be an important default for articles for being human- and machine-readable. Hence, if a server is capable of storing and serving resources in HTML, it will receive articles, annotations, and notifications in that form. Otherwise, dokieli will re-serialize the content into an alternative RDF syntax that the server prefers or is capable of handling per content-negotiation.</p>

                        <p>As of this writing, the reasons to use <code>HTTP POST</code> and <code>HTTP PUT</code> over <code>HTTP PATCH</code>, for documents like articles, are as follows:</p>

                      <p>Once an annotation is created and has a dereferenceable HTTP URI (subject to access control rules), a notification can be sent to the inbox of the target resource about the annotation if any part of an article advertises an LDN inbox. Depending on the motivation of the annotation, the notification is modelled with the <cite>Activity vocabulary</cite> eg. the <a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-create'>Create</a> activity (<code>as:Create</code>), to indicate that the actor has created the object.</p>

                      <p>In order to discover and view previously created annotations associated with an article, dokieli follows LDN\u2019s discovery mechanism for notifications about annotations, and then subsequently fetches the annotations in order to display them in context of their target selector.</p>

                    <h4 property='schema:name'>Activities</h4>
                    <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                      <p>The mechanism for personal identities, social graphs, and self-publishing articles and annotations enables a new layer of decentralised interactions. Here I describe how actors can discover units of information created or annotated in response to Web resources (like articles) by their social network without intermediaries (which includes the authors of the article or the features supported by the server it is published at). This scenario expands on <em>identity A knows identity B</em>, and <em>identity B has a <a href='#profile-knows-profile-storage'>storage</a> or <a href='#profile-knows-profile-outbox'>outbox</a></em> as declared in <a href='#linking-the-decentralised-information-space'>Linking the Decentralised Information Space</a>.</p>

                      <p>As each unit of information can be independently published and made accessible by an actor, one way to discover the information is by determining the relation between their WebID and the location of their collection of artifacts eg. under their personal storage (<code>pim:storage</code>) or activity outbox (<code>as:outbox</code>). The second connection between the actor that is interested in discovering such information and the actors which created them (<code>foaf:knows</code>). Hence, we are able to discover the reactions (like replies, comments, approvals, questioning, or annotations in general) made by the members of an actor\u2019s social graph.</p>

                      <p>In order to realise this scenario, the required components are as follows:</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Actor A wants to read annotations or activities around a unit of information.</li>
                        <li>Actor A knows actor B.</li>
                        <li>Actor B has a collection of artifacts.</li>
                        <li>Actor A has read access to Actor B\u2019s activity collection.</li>
                        <li>Actor A\u2019s application associates the unit of interest with actor B\u2019s annotation or activity.</li>
                        <li>Actor A\u2019s application displays the annotation in context of the unit of information.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>As these components are solely based on interoperable standards, any conforming application is able to interact with them, and perhaps more importantly, is not subject to <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190729124644/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in' data-versiondate='2019-07-29T12:46:44Z'>vendor lock-in</a></cite>.</p>

                      <p>This scenario is realised in dokieli, and works as a <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='#single-page-application'>single-page application</a></cite> or via the <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='#web-browser-extension'>Web browser extension</a></cite>. The Web Extension enables a new dimension to discovering and consuming independently published activities in that, a user can navigate to any HTTP URL and potentially discover and interact with annotations made by the members of their network. Thereby, a layer of decentralised and linked research space can exist independently, where any Web resource, perhaps typically an article, can be incorporated into the social or research discourse.</p>

                      <p>As each annotation (or unit of information) can have its own inbox, subsequent interactions with the annotation can be both stored at the annotator\u2019s storage and notified at the advertised inbox. This further decouples the components required to publish and consume content on the Web in an interoperable way. The decentralised activities in dokieli demonstrates the utility of independent publishing, semantic relations, as well as extensibility of structured Web objects.</p>

                      <p>A key aspect of the Social Web is sharing our creations and interests with the others.

Contacts whose profiles advertise an LDN Inbox will receive a notification of the share. The notification is modelled with the Activity vocabulary, eg. <a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-announce'>Announce</a>, to indicate that the actor is calling the target\u2019s attention to the object.

                    <h4 property='schema:name'>Semantic Citations</h4>
                    <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                      <p><cite><a href='#publishing-and-referencing'>Publishing and Referencing</a></cite> and <cite><a href='#scientific-expressions'>Scientific Expressions</a></cite> described some of the existing specifications to identify, integrate, and link assertions in research. The registration of units of information with URIs enables us to create RDF relations between citing and cited entities. For example, actors can link to specific statements within and across resources, as well as annotate their intentions while preserving the context when they are created.</p>

                      <p id='contextual-citations'><strong>Contextual Citations</strong>: One way to create a citation in dokieli is by authors selecting a node or a text fragment of interest in their document, and then inserting the URI of the resource to be linked to, as well as a specifying the type of semantic link between them in a specific or general way using the classifications available from the CiTO ontology eg. using <q>agrees with</q>, <q>confirms</q>, <q class='highlight-cites-as-evidence'>cites as evidence</q>. The input for the cited entity can be any HTTP URI, DOI string, or <abbr title='International Standard Serial Number'>ISSN</abbr> string, and when resolved from a corresponding HTTP URL, the content in RDF is used towards constructing the citation. dokieli takes the input target URI, and retrieves data (like title, authors) expressed in RDF in the linked document, integrates a statement expressed in RDF eg. figure <a href='#example-cites-as-evidence'>cites as evidence</a>, in context of the content, the citation intention as human-readable text, and adds a scientific endnote reference including the retrieved information. As a citation results in the assigning an HTTP URI for the citing entity, it can be further semantically annotated by the actor.</p>

                      <p id='robust-citations'><strong>Robust Citations</strong>: In order to preserve the context of the citation as well as taking content-drift and link-rot into account, first a snapshot of the cited entity\u2019s URI is created at the <cite>Internet Archive</cite>, and then both the archived URI and its datetime stamp is incorporated to the referencing hyperlink \u2013 the original citation resource.</p>

                      <p id='notifying-cited-entity'><strong>Notifying Cited Entity</strong>: Once a citation is made through the dokieli user interface, dokieli proceeds to check if the cited resource advertises its own LDN inbox, and if so, sends a notification indicating the citation function. This notification serves as a back-reference announcement, ie. being informed that a citation was made and thus creating discoverable <em>bi-directional linking</em> between the units of information. With the help of an inbox consumer, like dokieli, the cited article can also inform the reader about the back-references out there on the Web.</p>

                      <p id='citation-registrations'><strong>Registrations</strong>: The citation activity results in the registering HTTP URIs for the citing resource, archived snapshot, and the notification resource.</p>

                      <p>The following screenscast illustrates a clientside interaction in dokieli where the user cites a unit of information with a particular relationship, and a notification is sent to the cited entity\u2019s inbox.</p>

                      <p>It is possible to use dokieli\u2019s create operations as a composite to fulfill social and scholarly activities. One common scenario includes soliciting reviews, reviewing, announcement of the review, and final decisions made by community members. <a href='#core-mechanisms'>Core mechanisms</a>, <a href='#annotations'>annotations</a> and <a href='#sharing-resources'>sharing resources</a> in dokieli is as follows:</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Actor A publishes their article at preferred location.</li>
                        <li>Actor A sends Actor B a notification requesting a review of their article.</li>
                        <li>Actor B creates a derived copy of Actor A\u2019s article at their preferred location. The derived resource optionally includes its own inbox and annotation service.</li>
                        <li>Actor B reviews and annotates the derived resource by storing their annotations at preferred location. Notifications are sent to the inbox about the annotation.</li>
                        <li>Actor B archives their derived copy with annotations.</li>
                        <li>Actor B sends Actor A a notification sharing the location of the annotated resource.</li>
                        <li>Actor A visits Actor B\u2019s derived resource and discovers the review and annotations.</li>
                        <li>Actor B sends a notification to a community inbox that is dedicated to monitor scholarly activities about their review and annotations so that it can be discovered by other actors.</li>
                        <li>Actor C discovers Actor B\u2019s review through the community inbox.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>This particular scenario shows that it is possible for each actor to create and control resources, including articles, annotations, and notifications at their PDS or preferred locations. It is one way to combine standards-compliant mechanisms where actors can shape their content, self-publish, as well as share their works with other actors and services. In essence, the registration, certification, awareness, and archiving functions in scholarly communication are fulfilled in this scenario without a central authority.</p>

                    <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                      <p>Creating awareness and enabling actors to protect their data privacy is essential to fostering user\u2019s trust in the systems they use. The adoption of standards and practices with different <a href='#degree-of-control'>degree of control</a> can yield different privacy measures. In the decentralised and interoperable environment that dokieli operates in, there are a number of challenges and approaches. I discuss user privacy, data privacy, preferred proxy, and private activities below. The terms <q>anonymity</q>, <q>unlinkability</q>, <q>undetectability</q>, <q>unobservability</q>, and <q>pseudonymity</q> follow the definitions from <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='http://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.34.pdf' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190128120631/http://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.34.pdf' data-versiondate='2019-01-28T12:06:31Z'>A terminology for talking about privacy by data minimization: Anonymity, Unlinkability, Undetectability, Unobservability, Pseudonymity, and Identity Management</a></cite>, Pfitzmann, 2010.</p>

                      <p id='user-privacy'><strong>User Privacy</strong>: dokieli acts as a conduit to perform read-write operations against <abbr title='Personal Data Store'>PDS</abbr>. As the rules for read-write operations are set by servers, dokieli does not require the creation of user accounts at any server, in order to interact with the server\u2019s resources. Where applicable, actors can participate by maintaining their <em>anonymity</em>, <em>pseudonymity</em>, or can choose to identify themselves to dokieli by using their preferred <a href='#personal-identities'>personal identities</a>, without necessarily disclosing "real" information. Actors authenticate against the servers they prefer in order to perform access-controlled actions. It is possible for the environment in which dokieli operates in to transmit device, machine, or browser fingerprint, thereby potentially risking <em>unlinkability</em> \u2013 however, they are outside the control and scope of dokieli.</p>

                      <p id='data-privacy'><strong>Data Privacy</strong>: With respect to data privacy, actors can exercise their autonomy through the use of PDS for their profiles, articles, annotations, and notifications. As a <a href='#pds-expectation'>PDS can provide</a> us with the means to safeguard data, dokieli as a clientside application enables actors to perform <a href='#read-write-linked-data'>read-write Linked Data</a> operations where they prefer under their own conditions. With the help of access controls, a PDS that dokieli communicates with can potentially fulfill all minimizations \u2013 <q>anonymity</q>, <q>unlinkability</q>, <q>undetectability</q>, <q>unobservability</q>, <q>pseudonymity</q> \u2013 possibly with the exception of the domain name and IP that the PDS operates from.</p>

                      <p id='preferred-proxy'><strong>Preferred Proxy</strong>: A proxy acts as an intermediary between the clientside application and the destination server. This is useful in a number of scenarios for dokieli, such as getting around <a href='#mixed-content'>Mixed Content</a> issues, absence of <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212302/https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:02Z'>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</a></cite> (<abbr title='Cross-Origin Resource Sharing'>CORS</abbr>) support, as well as concealing the identity of the actor, fulfilling <em>anonymity</em>, <em>unlinkability</em>, <em>pseudonymity</em>, when making requests to a target server. An actor\u2019s preferred proxy can be determined by checking their WebID Profile description for the <code>solid:preferredProxy</code> relation, and if found, dokieli can use it to route requests when needed. Alternatively, a built-in (but user configurable) proxy location in dokieli is used.</p>

                      <p id='private-activities'><strong>Private Activities</strong>: The ability for actors to create and discover <a href='#activities'>activities</a> made within their social network without going through intermediaries, makes it possible to isolate units of information that is both access-controlled and invisible (or be unknown) to third-parties. These class of interactions in dokieli is aligned with the notion of <em>undetectability</em> and <em>unobservability</em>.</p>

                      <p>dokieli is a clientside application that uses the user-agent to interact with server applications. It has two deployment approaches including the same set of features: <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:02Z'>single-page application</a></cite> and <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_extension' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_extension' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:02Z'>Web browser extension</a></cite>.</p>

                      <p id='single-page-application'>dokieli\u2019s presentational and behavioural code layers can be included in Web "pages" in order to trigger them as active single-page applications. It is a smart client that allows different kinds of articles eg. academic, blog posts, news, to be authored and annotated from within Web browsers, without necessarily having them deployed from a server, ie. it can be used offline or on localhost. dokieli internally handles its content and structural and semantic representation based on user\u2019s actions and available information. Articles, profiles and their contact information, notifications, annotations with different motivations, for instance, can be read and written ubiquitously to any Web space with supporting HTTP methods and access control mechanisms.</p>

                      <p id='web-browser-extension'>The Web browser extension is a thin wrapper around dokieli\u2019s core code in order to embed itself in any HTML-based Web page on the Web. It inherits all of the features of a single-page application. While HTML based documents on the Web vary in their quality, dokieli\u2019s write operations generate HTML+RDFa. One of the utilities for the extension is to have a consistent interface for annotating node or text selections on a Web resource, building structured citations, creating derivations of Web resources as well as sharing document fragments with ones contacts via notifications, without having a service dependency or being limited by the Web page\u2019s UI.</p>

With an ontology and a user interface appropriate for the type of content, semantic authoring can be easier than traditional composition of content and the resulting content can be of higher quality.</q> The article proposes a set of <q>quality attributes</q> \u2013 as non-functional requirements \u2013 to evaluate the performance of SCA systems: usability, customizability, generalizability, collaboration, portability, accessibility, proactivity, automation, evolvability, interoperability, and scalability. Based on the starting point of the authoring process, the authors distinguish the approaches, and generally categorised as <q>bottom-up</q> (lifting unstructured content to a semantic level) or <q>top-down</q> (semantic representations from the beginning requiring users with the knowledge of the domain), and sometimes a hybrid of the two. A survey of tools are presented (in article\u2019s Table 3) covering different types of users, expected domain knowledge, and authoring approach. The article also discusses <cite>Research and Technology Challenges</cite> and identifies a gap in addressing <q>accessibility</q>, <q>handling complexity in UIs</q>, <q>formal and systematic methods for user interface evaluation</q>, <q>heuristic evaluation</q>, <q>support of crowdsourcing</q>, UIs for ubiquitous devices.</p>

                  <p>The scope of SCA is relevant because it covers some of the aspects of dokieli that can be examined. Hence, I use the structure of the table of results for SCA systems and include a dataset about <cite><a href='#quality-attributes-dokieli'>dokieli\u2019s quality attributes</a></cite>:</p>

I have also looked at the ongoing initiatives towards the decoupling of functions in scientific communication. Here I reuse some of these notions to situate dokieli with some existing work that can be (subjectively) <em>considered as representative</em> for different areas in <q>Web publishing</q>. There is plethora of examples for centralised and decentralised systems on the Web. Some of the authoring and publishing systems already fulfill some aspects of decentralised systems which operate over HTTP. I focus on degree of control with respect to applications, data and identity, privacy, accessibility, and interoperability.</p>

Users create accounts on these systems to perform access controlled read-write operations on data stored on the same server. These kind of systems allow users to authenticate with their identity provider from preconfigured authorities, as well providing their own accounts on the system. Each service generally has a custom API and vocabulary that a trusted client application (normally hosted on the same server) uses to interact with the server in order to perform <abbr title='Create, Read, Update, and Delete'>CRUD</abbr> operations through the user interface. They are categorically a client-server that is <cite><a href='#client-server-spectrum'>tightly coupled</a></cite> on identity, identification, authentication, authorization, and storage.</p>

Annotations may be private, public, or for a group, and can be threaded to form conversations around a piece of content. Each instance of a client application is preconfigured to use its own API endpoint against a particular server to perform CRUD operations, such as creating and finding annotations and related data. Actors use the client application to control the user accounts at a server or preconfigured identity providers eg. hypothes.is, orcid.org, acknowledged by a server. Annotations can be self-hosted, however different servers do not federate. The HTML representations of annotations requires JavaScript to be available and enabled on the user-agent in order to look up and fetch the annotation\u2019s contents in JSON from its API and update the <abbr title='Document Object Model'>DOM</abbr>. The annotation URLs, proxy, and the browser extension uses the <cite>Google Analytics</cite> tracking service per active URL. On active URLs, the client application by default makes API calls to the Hypothes.is server to check for annotations. On-demand archiving services like the Internet Archive are currently unable to properly archive an annotation\u2019s contents. It is possible to fetch an annotation that is represented with the WA Data Model from a server, however the annotation is not machine-discoverable ie. other applications will need to be uniquely configured with Hypothes.is\u2019s annotation URL template in order to acquire a JSON-LD representation - which is semantically a subset of the information provided in the HTML and JSON representations.</p>

                      <p>One common architectural aspect to these systems is that while they have some characteristics of a loosely coupled system, the server is expected to work with a designated client application. For instance, they require account creation and data storage with respect to an appointed centralised service. In essence, the user interface is restricted to communicate with a particular service endpoint, as well as an authority that governs all actor identities and the data they have produced. They allow multiple participants to annotate and hold discussions around the primary content; users must access their accounts to be notified of updates to conversations, and data from both the main content and related discussion is confined to the service which was used to create it. The data formats and schemas are consistent across storage instances in that it is possible to migrate data from one location to another using the same server application, storage mechanism and data schema. Archivability of Web resources varies and their access being at the discretion of server owners.</p>

In order to reference target resources, annotations used <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-element/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212307/https://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-element/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:07Z'>XML Pointer Language</a></cite> (<abbr title='XML Pointer Language'>XPointer</abbr>) to specify the part of HTML or XML-based documents that the annotation was in context of. Annotea laid out a path for subsequent systems, influencing <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212308/http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:08Z'>Open Annotation Data Model</a></cite> which later evolved into the WA Data Model.</p>

                      <p>Amaya and Annotea emerged at a time when publishing and consumption standards on the Open Web Platform were still relatively in the early phases. The most apparent conceptual similarities between the Amaya and Annotea combination with dokieli is that they treat the hosting document as one of the environments to perform read and write operations from.</p>

                      <hr></hr>

                      <p id='dokieli-hypothes.is'>A tentative view of the interoperability between Hypothes.is and dokieli is as follows. The client applications Hypothes.is and dokieli are non-conflicting in that when used in the same content or context, each can still be used on its own. A Hypothes.is client application can search and fetch annotations from an associated server using the Hypothes.is API, and render them on the target resource. dokieli can discover the WA annotation service of a Web resource, fetch annotations from servers conforming to WAP and LDP specifications, and render them on the target resource. Additional data about the annotation can be created and reused in both applications. A Hypothes.is client application can authenticate with a particular server using OAuth. Actors with WebID in dokieli can authenticate with servers supporting WebID-TLS and WebID-OIDC. Both can create annotations given authorization. Hypothes.is application can extend and direct annotations to a community group using the same server. dokieli triggers content negotiation with servers to determine preferred RDF serialization of Web Annotation and profile. The Hypothes.is client can only fetch annotations from a corresponding Hypothes.is server. dokieli can only fetch annotations from servers implementing LDP, WAP or AP. Putting the method of fetching an annotation resource aside, it is possible for either client application to render an annotation serialized as JSON-LD that is created by the other application. The notion of "private" content in Hypothes.is is tied to the annotation server that client application is associated with, whereas "private" content in dokieli is associated to actor\u2019s preferred storage location and access control policies based on individual, class of, or group WebIDs.</p>

                      <p>Existing server and client applications in particular to authoring and publishing are complex systems in that while they adhere or adopt some aspects of open Web specifications, they also include proprietary designs. Such systems also have varying characteristics of centralisation and decentralisation, hence, while some aspects are interoperable, other areas require post facto efforts to interop.</p>

                      <p>The tools which provide good collaborative editing user-interfaces appear to do so at the expense of data ownership and interoperability; those which promote creation and publication of data in open reusable formats are lacking facilities for linking discourse and conversation to concepts published. Decentralised creations also mean that each author can choose their own semantics eg. their own vocabulary to annotate using the RDF language, and then such decentralised documents can link to each other and their schemas can also be mapped to each other, whereas in centralised systems this is (if they support structured semantics at all) often prescribed, either technically enforced, or encouraged by social convention.</p>

                      <p>Future work can examine how additional features can be realised on top of existing Web standards, or where more development is required. Real-time collaborative editing is often realised with centralised communication (even though some peer to peer alternatives exist). Services like top-down annotations or automated entity marking can improve the discoverability of a publication, yet the question of how to offer these without being tied to certain servers as well as Web identities served from fixed servers needs further work.</p>

                      <p>dokieli shows that it is possible for people to interact with each other without central coordination. Users can choose storage space for their content independently of the applications with which they edit and view that content. Documents are connected statically through links and dynamically through Linked Data Notifications. This is a proof for the viability of a social and decentralised authoring and annotation environment based on Web standards. dokieli happens to be one application that demonstrates the potentials of decentralised notifications and annotations. The information it creates does not result in a vendor lock-in, as other applications are able to reuse them \u2013 given agreement on using open Web standards.</p>

                      <p>On the other hand, dokieli\u2019s use of standards shows that dokieli itself is only one means to an end: once the document has been created, it lives on independently. The <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_machine' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105639/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_machine' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:39Z'>social machine</a></cite> consists of people and documents, connected by Web standards, with dokieli acting as just one possible catalyst. Different Web applications can incorporate any of dokieli\u2019s functions and implement the principles to varying extent. Since the data is decoupled from the application, we avoid the <em>walled garden</em> problem of current social platforms today, as well as various forms of vendor lock-in with some applications, even if they are are operating in a loosely coupled environment. In essence, it is possible to swap dokieli with another client application and still communicate with any standards-compliant server. This is one of the key steps to liberating actors to create and share without setting burdens on URI, data and application control.</p>

                      <p>A couple of important sociotechnical challenges remain, and implications on autonomy. Resources might want to indicate in a granular way which actions they support or encourage, such as assessments, bookmarking, or sharing, and perhaps conditions about which notifications should be sent when any of these events take place. In order to encourage positive behaviour, we might want ways to provide moderation, and solutions to prevent harassment and abuse. Closely related is the issue of identity, pseudonymity and anonymity, and its relation with trust and verification. There are also social implications of dokieli\u2019s Web browser extension and social graph. For instance, the ability of annotating and sharing information even if the primary article does not have an inbox or an annotation service. There is no administrator that oversees everything, but that each actor has control privileges to what they are given. Having the ability to annotate anything and stored at a preferred location enables actor autonomy. This can be contrasted with annotation systems that may restrict annotations from getting created with particular targets or annotations having particular information in its body.</p>

                  <p>Based on the observations and patterns involving the <cite><a href='#knowledge-goals'>Knowledge Goals</a></cite> and <cite><a href='#technical-research-problems'>Technical Research Problems</a></cite>, I state the <em>Linked Research design principles</em>:</p>

                  <p>With respect to the <cite><a href='#effects-and-artifacts'>Effects and Artifacts</a></cite>, the design principles are intended to <q>enhance</q> the physical, social, psychological, and intellectual functions of an <em>actor</em> in context of the Web and scholarly communication.

                    <h4 property='schema:name'>Autonomy</h4>
                    <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                      <p>Today it would be difficult to think of a Web without social functions. Perhaps the Web\u2019s support and ability to facilitate social interactions \u2013 above anything else \u2013 contributed to the transformation of societies in the last quarter century. The Web, as a medium, expedited all patterns of social interrelationships in a manner that can be more efficiently documented, discovered and reused. It necessitates that system designs should be inclusive and facilitate <em>involvement</em> within the range of an actor\u2019s autonomy. Furthermore, actors should be able to use socially-aware decentralised applications that can perform the core functions in scholarly communications \u2013 registration, awareness, certification, and archiving.</p>

                      <p>The systems that are designed to fulfill the functions in scholarly communication should operate with the expectation of autonomous participation. One value that can be upheld through the principle of autonomy is to not have any constraints on where units of communication can exist on the Web. For instance, the actors of a system can have the freedom to designate identifiers to their artifacts: profile(s), articles, annotations, notifications, data, and so forth, as well as where they can be retrieved from. Similarly, the actor\u2019s autonomy to use preferred applications to interact with data. The <em>decentralisation</em> of the information space is <em>a</em> means to gain autonomy on the Web. With respect to <em>delocalisation</em>, units of information, eg. personal Web identifiers (WebID) controlled by their owners, can be used across different systems as they need not be tied to any particular URI space or system, and are free from external influences. Ultimately, autonomy is the right to freely choose and maintain sovereignty over URI ownership and data spaces, and the ability to use or switch between applications that can interact with them. Likewise, actors\u2019 autonomy would not obstruct them to use shared URI spaces if they so desire.</p>

                      <p>Any type of object, eg. scientific literature, research objects, personal websites, profiles and social graphs, can be made available on the Web provided that the <em>actors</em> have sufficient control over their URIs, or delegate to entities they trust. Through URI ownership, deconstructing and decoupling of resources can take place.</p>

                      <p>The contents of HTTP URLs may be logically centralised or decentralised. For example, the media representations found at the URL can embed compound or dynamic components that are dependent on external (remote) URLs. In this particular case, the persistence of the external URLs, as well as whether their contents are immutable is a design concern.</p>

                      <p>Autonomy is an important ingredient to fully exercise <em>freedom of expression</em>, which is a civil liberty. If a URI is governed by a third-party entity, ie. other than the researcher who shares the contents of a scientific resource, then it is possible that the URLs may no longer resolve, and the content may be subject to change in ways beyond researcher\u2019s control. Whereas without intermediaries, the researcher has sufficient access and control as to what happens at their URI space. This gives actors the ability to exercise <em>self-registration</em> with respect to the registration function. Trust in this case may be placed on the Web space that is closer to the owner and publisher of the URI.</p>

                      <p>The right to have <em>freedom of expression</em> necessitates that the articulation of scholarly contributions are not subject to arbitrary interference from third-parties, and allow actors to seek the most appropriate ways to co-create and co-participate. We inherit:</p>

                      <p id='freedom-of-expression-constraints'>Freedom of expression in context of academic communication does not entail that any arbitrary artifact eg. self-published articles, passes quality-control and certification from the community, or ethically appropriate. By free expression, I mean that actors should not be subject to <em>technical constraints</em> on how they communicate their discoveries and knowledge with the rest of the world. That is, to have the means to <em>shape</em> machine-readable structure and semantics, presentations, and interactions. Enrolling in the certification process of some literature can for instance mean that reviewers may engage in any aspect and granularity of the contribution itself, eg. a weakness for an argument in one literature can be contrasted (and linked) with a scientific result presented in another literature. Academic freedom to express entails that researchers caring out their work comply with discipline-specific methods and meet standards related to accuracy, precision, completeness, reliability, relevance, and so forth. Furthermore, as with human rights, the ability to express does not grant unethical practices at the expense of any person or group. Technical expressions that are harmful or discriminatory, eg. inaccessible content, constrained presentations, or undesirable user interactions, should be avoided.</p>

                      <p>The concerns about authenticity, persistence and permanence of data and knowledge is constant regardless of where the resources reside on the Web. Hence, strictly trusting scholarly knowledge based on its registered location is ultimately fragile in that it is unavoidable to prevent all sorts of threats to preservation in a long enough timeline. However, since the registration function is decoupled from archiving, we are able to delegate that trust to a third-party that is best fit to handle the preservation and to some extent guarantee the authenticity of the units of communication. This is particularly important as archival and trust are part of the global scholarly commons.</p>

                      <p>In context of the Web, technical or social decentralisation at all levels is unattainable. Even open Web standards are based on social and technical decisions, and can be seen as a form of centralisation in that conforming systems cluster and coordinate among themselves. Similarly, centralisation naturally occurs in social systems like concepts or language, eg. machine-readable vocabularies restrict the set of uses of a system. The alternative pushed to the extreme where each unit is expressed in their own language and without any language mapping, puts us in a situation similar to that of the <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212311/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:11Z'>Tower of Babel</a></cite>, ie. being incapable of understanding each other. Hence, autonomy in a system where researchers are isolated or information is not interpretable renders freedom of expression meaningless.</p>

                      <p>The <abbr title='Architecture of the World Wide Web'>AWWW</abbr> states that agents, <em>interpret</em> available <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#dereference-details'>representation according to the data format specification that corresponds to the representation\u2019s Internet Media Type.</q> Here we can use the term <em>interpretation</em> in the general sense for both human and machine consumers of representations. An interpretation entails that a given content can be identified or discovered; comprehended in context of where and how it is used; as well being to put it to further use. Scientific and scholarly knowledge representations using information models that are based on Web standards brought through open consensus benefit from wide reuse.</p>

                      <p id='interoperability'><strong>Interoperability</strong>: In order to achieve cooperative systems, interoperable mechanisms are essential. One widely successful approach to have interoperable systems is through the adoption of open standards for protocols and languages that are arrived through open consensus. As per Linked Data design principles, this is accomplished with HTTP for communication, URI for identification, and RDF as language. While a decentralised system can enable each entity to be autonomous, some level of agreement is needed on the network for communication to take place. Systems that are interoperable by design have the benefit of interacting with other systems without having prior or out-of-band knowledge about them. This kind of interoperability can be contrasted with <em>post-facto</em> interoperability that is typically due to propriety designs at the discretion of each party, and then bridging the systems with application adapters and semantic mappings. In such cases, given two systems, one system adopts the others\u2019 protocol, API, or format, or they build specialised mechanisms in order to communicate. Systems that do not use open standards or have specialised technological extensions that are only useful within their own environment are generally considered to be vendor lock-in solutions. Here we seek agreements on Web standards established through open consensus, as opposed to independent and individual design choices made in application implementations.</p>

                      <p>Systems vary on their level of interoperability. For instance, a service may require their own user account or authentication mechanism to be used when interacting with data on the Web; users may have to use a particular application to access, create, share or reuse information; applications may need to be reconfigured to reuse the information that is created elsewhere. In the <cite><a href='#acid-test'>Acid Test</a></cite> section I propose criteria to self-assess accessibility and interoperability of artifacts in scholarly communication.</p>

                      <p>There is a balance between free expression of structure and semantics (through autonomy) and the degree of a communication (interoperability) that different parties can achieve. At the same time, as concentration or centralisation of ideas is ultimately inescapable, interoperability influences or limits the choices a system can take. Hence, we embrace the notion of interoperability as a trade-off, ie. it is better to seek and adapt design patterns that are expected or intended to be useful for the ecosystem. Hence, interoperability is a social construct with the intention of balancing autonomy and cooperative systems.</p>

                      <p>In order to have optimal means of discovery, exchanging, and reusing information, systems and data should opt for open standards and widely acknowledged best practices wherever possible. Linked Data technologies include some of the essentials to achieve this, and are well-suited to fulfill the four functions of scholarly communication on the Web.</p>

                      <p>Thus we refer to <q>universal access</q> in the widest sense that any agent; human, machine, or other can effectively access information and participate in interacting with different systems.</p>

                      <p>To demonstrate the extensibility of units of communication within the frame of Linked Research, I extend the LDN <cite><a href='#test-suite-and-implementation-reports'>Test Suite and Implementation Reports</a></cite> and <cite><a href='#linked-data-notifications-implementations'>Implementations</a></cite> and describe the development of an interlinked, human- and machine-readable W3C Recommendation, its test suite, and implementation reports as a whole.</p>

                      <p>The missing connection among existing specifications and test reports is that a uniform resource discovery is not possible between the test reports and the individual conformance criteria in the specifications, where a given information at a particular URL is both human- and machine-processable (see <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsDataSource' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-specifications-reports#related-work' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212249/https://csarven.ca/linked-specifications-reports' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:49Z'>Linked Specifications, Test Suites, and Implementation Reports Related Work</a></cite>.)</p>

                      <p>Having the specifications and implementation reports interlinked and retrievable can facilitate their automated discovery and reuse. One use case is to be able to find applications that match a certain conformance criteria, eg. in order to have fine-grained bundling of software packages. While this would typically include "normative requirements", tests can potentially capture and reveal optional features of specifications. Prospective consumers of the compliance reports can be application developers finding appropriate software for use, as well as automatic software package managers.</p>

                  <p>There is an abundance of scientific information on the Web. However, humans and machines have restricted access, are required to pay, or hindered to efficiently discover relations. The knowledge industry can better address societal challenges by embracing the virtues of the Web via decentralisation and interconnectivity of our collective knowledge.</p>

                  <p id='mirroring-the-web'><strong>Mirroring the Web</strong>: LR is an initiative to strive to experience the full effects of the Web by observing and making use of its affordances. LR serves as a conceptual framework that describes how actors can control their interactions and data, make use of human- and machine-readable information through Web-interfaces, as well as how decentralised and socially-aware applications can exchange information on route to fulfilling the core functions of scholarly communication.</p>

                  <p id='traps'><strong>Traps</strong>: Are there ideological and technology traps in LR? The traps can be seen as analogous to McLuhan\u2019s <cite><a href='#effect-reverses-into'>Reverses Into</a></cite> effect. When the LR design principles are "pushed to the extreme", highly specialised and fine-grained centralised systems may emerge while still operating within the larger decentralised system on the Web. The degree of interoperability among the autonomous systems will vary. The artifacts may be controlled or managed by a new generation of entities in information spaces, eg. agents delegated to perform certain operations on behalf of an actor. Just as centralised publishing and distribution services currently exist for the dominating print-centric industry, the medium can still accommodate similar control over semantic and granular scientific resources. Individual autonomy without cooperation among the actors can make it difficult to establish and maintain trust.</p>

                  <p id='reconfiguring-forces-and-functions'><strong>Reconfiguring Forces and Functions</strong>: The existing or prior models for information exchange that has been described so far primarily focus on institutional or subject repository driven scholarly communication. They inherently require the involvement of third-party service providers \u2013 for- or non-profit \u2013 which impose a particular arrangement of the coupling of the scholarly information space per <em>forces and functions</em>. For instance, traditional journals most commonly couple the registration and certification functions, whereas the configuration based on LR allows different actors to activate different functions on demand.</p>

                  <p id='basic-costs'><strong>Basic Costs</strong>: From the perspective of an actor, the costs for a personal domain name along with data storage can be in the range of 100 USD per year with sufficient space for common Web publishing \u2013 "unlimited" amount of registration of units of communication and publishing any hypermedia. As for archiving services, it would be typically handled by "external" stakeholders with respect to the actor sharing their registered content.</p>

                  <p id='social-barriers'><strong>Social Barriers</strong>: At this time, promotion and tenure are integral to the academic profession. The incentives in the academic profession predominantly relies on an ecosystem that is largely led by third-party publishers and services. LR can be seen as market driven from the perspective of self-driven actors in the system \u2013 similar to proponents of the preprint movement.</p>

                <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                  <p>With the arrival and the adoption of the Web by the masses, a <q>paradigm shift</q> \u2013 from print to electric \u2013 had occurred. Sociotechnical advancements in the past three decades in context of the Web serves as an evidence of the shift towards using the Web as a primary environment (medium) for "normal" scholarly communication. Put into historical perspective, we are indeed operating in the early phase of this new paradigm. Thus, I content that all advancements \u2013 no matter how radical they appear or claim to be \u2013 still operate within the framework of the Web, regardless of content shaped as if for print, being accessible to the privileged, controlled by third-party entities, and so forth.</p>

                  <p>I will use Kuhn\u2019s five characteristics \u2013 <q><a href='#paradigm-characteristics'>accuracy, consistency, scope, simplicity, and fruitfulness</a></q> from <cite><a href='#objectivity-value-judgment-and-theory-choice'>Objectivity, Value Judgment, and Theory Choice</a></cite> \u2013 to measure the quality of <cite>Linked Research</cite> as a shared <em>sub-</em>paradigm for scholarly communication on the Web. The criteria is not intended to be exhaustive but, rather, used to cover varied aspects to situate LR. I provide these descriptions for the purpose of assisting <cite><a href='#stakeholders'>stakeholders</a></cite> gain a perspective on LR\u2019s values, facilitate determining its adequacy for use, as well as to evaluate LR against other models.</p>

                  <p>LR is based on the notion that the Web is inherently decentralised, social, and for everyone. Its design principles shapes data and systems to be built on open Web standards to carry out scholarly activities.</p>

                  <p id='paradigm-accuracy'><strong>Accuracy</strong>: LR is based on the core mechanisms for identification, interaction, and representation of units of information on the Web. For instance, <cite><a href='#semantic-citations'>semantic citations</a></cite> enables actors to build precise and contextual relations between atomic units, preserve author\u2019s intentions at the time of citing, create a snapshot of the target while citing, as well as announce the citation activity. Thus, the creation, dissemination, and discovery of typed citations (as opposed to generic citations), brings forth an accurate representation of a network of shared knowledge. In this respect, LR is empirically adequate within the frame of what Linked Data vocabularies can potentially express irrespective of where the cited entities are located on the Web.</p>

                  <p id='paradigm-consistency'><strong>Consistency</strong>: LR is consistent within itself as per the alignment with the <cite><a href='#architecture-of-the-web'>Architecture of the Web</a></cite> and using open Web standards (in contrast to print-centric approaches on the Web). LR adopts the notion of actors having free and unrestricted access to knowledge, and thus consistent with several community principles and initiatives with the same goal, eg. the Open Access movement, self-archiving of literature so that it is readable by anyone for free, Semantic Web publishing. In this respect, LR is a continuation or aligned with the theme to democratise knowledge through the use of the Web. On the other hand, with respect to the common social practices around "publishing", LR is explicit about actors (content creators) ultimately deciding how to make their contributions. Hence, LR is inconsistent with the existing practice or market-driven notion of requiring actors to use particular third-party services in order to participate in scientific and knowledge exchange, as well as the way in which contributions are acknowledged by relevant stakeholders. From this perspective, LR\u2019s notion of an "actor" can be interpreted to be <em>incommensurable</em> with the "actor" in the contemporary scholarly system. Furthermore, LR is currently a technology driven change as opposed to market driven change in that the added value comes from a way to reconfigure the interplay of forces and functions. However, it is not a paradigmatic change in terms of strategic repositioning and development of the forces and functions eg. who can ultimately be an actor and their potential competences.</p>

                  <p id='paradigm-scope'><strong>Scope</strong>: LR has broad scope in that knowledge can be incrementally connected and extended (at any time) by using shared identifiers for units of communication and compatible data models. Through the use of languages like RDF, information discovery mechanism remains uniform.</p>

                  <p id='paradigm-simplicity'><strong>Simplicity</strong>: LR is a "lossless" approach to representing and sharing information on the Web in that the content can be registered independently from its presentation and behaviour, thus making it possible to refer and connect units of communication at any level of abstraction. As machine-readable representation is encoded through the serialisation of the RDF language, the underlying information can be transformed into alternative serialisations without compromising its integrity. The Open Web Platform makes it possible to treat and handle content "as is" without requiring supplemental protocols, proprietary plug-ins, or external tools to create and share content.</p>

                  <p id='paradigm-fruitfulness'><strong>Fruitfulness</strong>: Machine-readable information facilitates discovery and reuse of units of communication. As in the case of semantic citations, LR opens up the possibility to create as well as detect precise relations which were previously unnoted or disclosed through appropriate interoperable standards. Units of communication in the form of a knowledge graph being machine-identifiable and queryable has the affordance to detect or inspect patterns. For instance, open research questions can be found by analysing semantically structured literature, as well as detecting topical trends in research communities. LR\u2019s design principles enables the use of existing and future open Web standards. Its continuous interoperability would permit LR to be evolvable.</p>

                  <p>Whether to use the LR model will depend on the "value judgment" of stakeholders and the research community. LR is merely a reflection of using the Web to its full potential for scholarly communication.

                    <dd>Linked Data Notifications is a communication protocol that describes how applications can perform the roles of <em>senders</em>, <em>receivers</em>, and <em>consumers</em> when exchanging notifications. Such decoupling of application roles in context of a client\u2013server model permits interoperability between two classes of interactions, senders and receivers, or between consumers and receivers. These are atomic interactions in that they facilitate the design of loosely coupled systems that can exchange structured notifications as Linked Data. As such, the LDN protocol affords a high <cite><a href='#degree-of-control-in-ldn'>degree of control</a></cite> to actors in that they can use their preferred applications, store notifications where they prefer, switch between applications without relocating the notifications, and relocate the notifications without having to change applications. LDN\u2019s underlying mechanism triggers <em>registration</em>, fulfills <em>awareness</em>, and can support fulfilling the <em>certification</em> and <em>archiving</em> <cite><a href='#ldn-forces-functions'>functions in scientific communication</a></cite> in a decentralised ecosystem.</dd>

                    <dt id='technical-research-problems-artifacts-review'>How can Web technologies be employed to fulfill the core functions of scholarly communication in an open and interoperable way?</dt>
                    <dd>A decentralised client application based on the <cite>Open Web Platform</cite> can be devised to allow independent actors to exchange units of communication with decentralised storage services. <cite>dokieli</cite> demonstrates how an assembly of Web standards can come together in a cohesive way in order to enable actors to reach a high <cite><a href='#degree-of-control-in-dokieli'>degree of control</a></cite> over their creations and social activities. HTTP is used to perform CRUD operations, (HTTP) URIs to identify Web resources, and Linked Data design principles to uniformly represent, link, and discover information. Actors can identify themselves through WebID (HTTP URI) whether tied to a real or fictitious entity, extend their profile descriptions, and authenticate against servers with mechanisms like WebID-TLS and WebID-OIDC. Machine-interpretable profile descriptions also enables the client application to adapt to accommodate actor\u2019s capabilities. It is feasible to create and consume human- <em>and</em> machine-readable units of (scholarly) communication using standards such as RDFa in HTML, and be combined with other RDF serialisations based on technical specifications. A variety of Linked Data vocabularies can be used for semantic content authoring. The Linked Data Notifications protocol is used to exchange structured notifications. The Web Annotation Data Model and Protocol is used to associate resources and exchange annotations. The ActivityPub protocol is used to exchange social activities. The resources that dokieli generates are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable by other standards-compliant Linked Data applications. The resulting technical design operates under the notion of a scholarly ecosystem where applications are decoupled to fulfill the registration, awareness, certification, and archiving <cite><a href='#dokieli-forces-functions'>functions in scholarly communication</a></cite>.</dd>
                  </dl>

                  <p>In summary, Linked Data Notifications is a building block for diverse decentralised and loosely coupled Web applications to exchange notifications, and fulfills the <em>awareness</em> function in scholarly communication. dokieli demonstrates how <abbr title='Registration, Awareness, Certification, Archiving'>RACA</abbr>-aware Linked Data applications can be designed while fulfilling essential <cite><a href='#decentralised-web-publishing'>decentralised Web publishing</a></cite> requirements.</p>

                <h3 property='schema:name'>Interpretations</h3>
                <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                  <p>In this section I reflect on what the findings of this thesis can mean to us and why we should care.</p>

                  <p id='paygo-linked-data'><strong>PAYGO Linked Data</strong>: Publishing units of communication by following the Linked Data principles is similar to the <cite><a href='#paygo'>pay as you go</a></cite> approach in dataspace systems in that knowledge on the Web can be extended incrementally without having everything up front or even a commitment to do so. This is particularly evident when disparate collection of units (or graphs) published by different entities can be connected when they share globally identifiable entities, as well as being universally useful when the content they identify is accessible.</p>

                  <p id='fair-linked-data'><strong>FAIR Linked Data</strong>: For openly accessible resources, I note that the <cite><a href='#linked-data'>Linked Data</a></cite> approach and technology stack can fulfill the <cite><a href='#fair-guiding-principles'>FAIR guiding principles</a></cite>. One generalisation that could be made from this is that Linked Data design principles can be adopted as a base requirement when building interoperable Web applications, which would also fulfill FAIR. After all, the FAIR principles does not prescribe the mechanisms for Web data, and as such, interoperability across applications for independently produced FAIR-conformance is not systematically guaranteed. In contrast, the Linked Data approach specifies the mechanisms within the framework of the <cite><a href='#architecture-of-the-web'>Architecture of the Web</a></cite> and guarantees interop.</p>

                  <p id='decentralised-identity-and-authentication'><strong>Decentralised Identity and Authentication</strong>: Applications primarily operate in a read-only information space in the absence of decentralised identities and authentication mechanisms. Client applications can be loosely coupled with servers when the source of authentication is distributed. Actors can use independently built client applications to perform CRUD operations provided that they can authenticate using their preferred WebID, as well as have the possibility to decide on the storage location of their data. Thus, it is possible to distribute scholarly contributions on the Web based on an actor (or contributor) centric model.</p>

                  <p id='interoperable-applications'><strong>Interoperable Applications</strong>: Decoupling of the forces and functions in scholarly communication in context of the Web necessitates interoperable applications through the use of standard data formats and communication protocols. These class of applications need to only reflect user\u2019s intent within the frame of a loosely coupled system design. That is, applications having semantic understanding of the affordances of the system makes it possible to automate information exchange. Consequently enabling users to switch between standards-compliant applications without interfering with existing data. For instance, HTTP, URI, and HTML are widely used standards on the Web enabling us to use any user agent (like a Web browser) on the Open Web Platform. Similarly, one layer up on the interoperability ladder would be to employ communication protocols and data formats that are capable of addressing specific use cases.</p>

                  <p id='sociotechnical-centralisation'><strong>Sociotechnical Centralisation</strong>: We can observe different forms of centralisation within decentralisation. As we adopt mechanisms with the intention of decentralisation and interoperability, are we free of all forms of centralisation and vendor lock-ins? For instance, <cite><a href='#uri-ownership'>URI Ownership</a></cite> discussed the inherent social centralisation of DNS in that individuals merely rent domain names from registrars and maintain the mapping to physical servers. <cite><a href='#semantic-organisation-of-notifications'>Semantic Organisation of Notifications</a></cite> highlights one form of organic centralisation around the choice of Linked Data vocabularies that the applications make use of. Technical Web specifications for the most part reflect the group\u2019s goals, cultural norms or biases. For instance, LDN was initially incubated in the <cite><a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://solid.mit.edu/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190628115812/https://solid.mit.edu/' data-versiondate='2019-06-28T11:58:12Z'>Solid project</a></cite> within the understanding of a socially-aware read-write Linked Data paradigm, and then developed to be a technical specification through the W3C <abbr title='Social Web Working Group'>SWWG</abbr> as part of a broader context of decentralisation efforts.</p>

                  <p id='aaa-raca'><strong>AAA in RACA</strong>: <cite><a href='#function-of-peer-review'>Function of Peer Review</a></cite> noted the intentions and limits of peer review in context of the Web. It is neither the case that the right, the privilege, or the practice of the notion <q><a href='#aaa'>anyone being (technically) allowed to say anything about anything</a></q> is exempt from ethical considerations. As we have seen in modern Web social media, management and distribution of misinformation and disinformation is profitable and poses a danger to civilisation. For instance, as electronic publication has also been blurring the lines between academic work and personal opinions, making the distinction between the two as part of the scientific endeavour has only become more vital. In that respect, the notion of <cite><a href='#self-publishing'>self-publishing</a></cite> does not entail quality-controlled and certified units of communication in and itself, but rather focuses on increasing actors\u2019 immediate role and control. Thus, trust and accountability remain as social processes.</p>

                  <p id='school-of-thought'><strong>School of Thought</strong>: Some of dokieli\u2019s design decisions were driven by the need to enable actors to autonomously participate in a decentralised scholarly ecosystem. With respect to the four functions in scientific communication, the expectations are to operate under a <em>deconstructed</em> or <em>decoupled</em> model while providing high <cite><a href='#degree-of-control'>Degree of Control</a></cite> to content creators and consumers, as well as generating and reusing interoperable data. This approach shares some conceptual similarities to the <q cite='http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ginsparg/physics/blurb/pg01unesco.html'>self-archiving</q> approach in that scholars have the right to freely share their Web resources from open repositories. However, a distinction between the <q>self-archiving</q> initiative and <cite><a href='#self-publishing'>self-publishing</a></cite> in context of the <cite><a href='#linked-research'>Linked Research</a></cite> goal can be made in that while an actor may prefer to share their contributions through third-party controlled components, the baseline for <q>self-publishing</q> is that they are not required to. Thus, the network location and the applications that are used to make the content available are orthogonal to the notion of what constitutes a scholarly contribution. Lastly, parallel characteristics between dokieli\u2019s approach and the <cite><a href='#republic-of-letters'>Republic of Letters</a></cite> can be made in that both operate under the idea of scholarly activities to be a researcher-centric model \u2013 direct information exchange between authors and readers \u2013 without requiring intermediaries.</p>

                  <p id='sociotechnical-advancement'><strong>Sociotechnical Advancement</strong>: Given our half a millennia of experience in mass print publishing, and half a century on electronic publishing, we are in a position to situate, examine and question our assumptions as to what constitutes scholarly knowledge exchange and participation in context of the Web. If research communication is predominately and increasingly driven by the Web, how can we approach the integration of scholarly processes with the inherent properties of the Web? One way to look at this is by <cite><a href='#the-printing-press-as-an-agent-of-change'>examining history</a></cite>: the printing press played a major role in moving the non-literate public to learn to read and write for themselves. Given the Web, we find ourselves in a similar situation with different modes of communication. For instance, the Web \u2013 an environment for simultaneous read and write operations on hypermedia \u2013 inherently enables anyone to be a publisher, where each actor can exercise their full creativity and ability to express the shape of their content. In order to use the Web effectively \u2013 as far as taking advantage of its built-in characteristics, the research community needs to better position itself to self-publish and disseminate their knowledge, as well as be more attributable and accountable in their social engagement. This kind of ongoing evolution is necessary for the advancement of research communication and consequently the society. Moving towards Web-centric information flow requires the scholarly ecosystem to unchain itself from antiquated practices and inadequate use of the available medium. In context of major communication shifts, we have not scratched the surface \u2013 30 years into the advent of the Web is still a brief period in history.</p>

                  <p id='addressing-social-implications'><strong>Addressing Social Implications</strong>: <cite><a href='#social-implications'>Social Implications of LDN</a></cite> looked at a particular area of design considerations for notifications. <cite><a href='#activities'>dokieli\u2019s Activities</a></cite> describes how a "friend of a friend" social network can work. An AAA-based ecosystem while can potentially enable everyone to voice themselves, the Web is not immune to the distribution of propaganda, cyberbullying or hate speech. How can we cultivate positive behaviour, and design systems to discover and filter content based on ethical norms or personal preferences? Thus, in context of <cite><a href='#decentralised-web-publishing'>decentralised Web publishing</a></cite>, future research can investigate:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>How can harassment and abuse be prevented or handled?</li>
                    <li>How would moderation or civil discourse work?</li>
                    <li>How can a resource prohibit or consent to be annotated at fine granularity?</li>
                    <li>How can the conditions to annotate and notify be indicated and monitored?</li>
                    <li>How can a resource\u2019s annotation policy and rules be respected?</li>
                    <li>What may be the conditions to associate different identities?</li>
                    <li>How can domain expertise be factored in?</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>The W3C TAG Finding, <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212314/https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:14Z'>Ethical Web Principles</a></cite>, 2019, sets out ethical principles which will guide the Technical Architecture Group. These principles can be applied when designing systems in order to provide a net positive social benefit.</p>

                  <p id='extended-profiles'><strong>Extended Profiles</strong>: WebID Profile descriptions can be extended to enable richer decentralised clientside applications in that both the user interface and the content can be a reflection of actor\u2019s preferences and abilities. What kinds of "preference negotiation" can be made?</p>

                  <p id='privacy-aware-information-space'><strong>Privacy Aware Information Spaces</strong>: Actors can be better supported in their decision-making if their applications are privacy-aware and respecting, for example through the use of standards like <abbr title='Open Digital Rights Language'>ODRL</abbr>. This leads to the possibility of observing the interplay of forces and functions in scholarly communication, and in particular, how privacy-aware applications can generate and consume new forms of content and interactions. How can a decentralised ecosystem balance privacy, integrity and availability?</p>

                  <p id='lossless-citations'><strong>Lossless Citations</strong>: Applications supporting semantic content authoring enables fine-grained connections to be created between units of communication. Approaches like in <cite><a href='#contextual-citations'>contextual citations</a></cite> (with semantically typed relations) make it possible to preserve authors\u2019 intended connection between units of communication. Further study on creating, annotating, as well as extracting citation Linked Data can provide further insights into (scholarly) content. How can open research questions be systematically discovered by machines?</p>

                  <p typeof='skos:Concept' resource='#raca-aware-applications' rel='schema:hasPart' id='raca-aware-applications'><strong property='skos:prefLabel'>RACA-Aware Applications</strong>: <span property='skos:definition'><cite><a href='#forces-and-functions-in-specifications' rel='cito:extends'>Forces and Functions in Specifications</a></cite> characterised open Web protocols, standards, and models in context of scholarly communication. While this contribution is not intended to be a complete collection of approaches, future work can extend the current <cite><a href='#characteristics-of-specifications'>RDF Data Cube dataset</a></cite> and the EARL results including additional subjects with new observations. The availability of such structured dataset can help answering the knowledge questions of future research when designing "<dfn property='skos:altLabel'>RACA-Aware</dfn>" decentralised and interoperable applications. Thus, potentially answering a research question along the lines of <em>How can we systematically remix open Web specifications in order to design RACA-Aware applications?</em> Another area of research would be for applications to systematically and adaptively determine, as well as apply the right abstraction level for content based on actor\u2019s needs.</span></p>

                  <p id='on-demand-archiving'><strong>On-Demand Archiving</strong>: While there are publicly usable on-demand archiving services eg. Internet Archive, there is a need for client applications to be able to both choose from existing archiving services as well as allow users to specify their preferred services when making <em>contextual citations</em> or archiving any unit of communication. To that end, future research can investigate how personal or community-controlled archiving services can be designed in order to enable decentralised client applications.</p>

                  <p id='linked-data-aware-user-agents'><strong>Linked Data-Aware User Agents</strong>: At the moment, common user agents like the Web browser are not natively equipped to parse and re-serialise data expressed with the RDF language, or have the ability to construct SPARQL queries and process query results, yet alone adapt the user interface based on content. Consequently, client applications and Web Extensions are forced to include (JavaScript) code libraries to handle these features until there is built-in support. Such method of inclusions increases the complexity of using as well as maintaining the libraries. Future research can investigate effective ways to natively integrate RDF and SPARQL libraries and support corresponding APIs in the Web browser so that client applications can focus on higher-level user intentions as opposed to lower-level data management.</p>

                  <p id='third-party-control-considered-harmful'><strong>Third-Party Control Considered Harmful</strong>: The current state of scholarly communication on the Web is ravelled with sociotechnical limits and complications. The overarching technical research problem aimed to investigate and design Web-centric artifacts that would enable content creators and consumers to have more control over their activities, as well as to effectively exchange information while respecting actors\u2019 privacy. The Web continues to enable anyone to be a publisher. The findings of thesis reveals that third-party publishers are not required and that <cite><a href='#decentralised-web-publishing'>decentralised Web publishing</a></cite> is, and ultimately continues to be, feasible <em>for everyone</em>.</p>

              <hr></hr>

              <p id='to-boldly-go-where-we-have-not-gone-before'><strong>To boldly go where we have not gone before</strong>: I contend that one way to advance research communication on the Web in its totality is that, social policies, funding, research exchange, as well as professional incentives, all need to accurately reflect the affordances of the media. The Linked Research initiative ironically indicates the need for a <em>counter-environment</em> as a means of practising the dominant and unnoticed environment, that is the Web as a socially-aware communication medium. The social conventions that surrounds the notion of a "scholarly contribution" can be anticipated to be revisited in order to improve the accessibility of knowledge, and be more inclusive and equitable for everyone. The evolution of sociotechnical systems require people\u2019s adaptability at the same time. In order for the scholarly ecosystem to be genuinely \u201copen\u201d and inclusive, systems need to be ethically grounded and interoperate with the notion of <q>universal design</q> \u2013 actor diversity with variations in needs, capabilities, and aspirations.</p>

              <p>I propose the notion of <cite><a href='#linked-research'>Linked Research</a></cite> as a potentially useful shared paradigm for scholarly activities on the Web. <span id='call-for-activities'>You are cordially invited to <em>self-publish</em> and share your activities related to any unit of significance in this thesis.</span></p>

              <p>So there we have it. It is all sort of simple.</p>

While Eisenstein\u2019s account of the history is not regarded as doctrine, the work demonstrates that the printing press, as a technological innovation, was a potent force in the evolution of social systems, as well as a communication technology which intensified the evolutionary process in the storage and dissemination of information and data. Perhaps more generally, Eisenstein explains how <q>printing altered <em>written communications within the Commonwealth of Learning</em></q>, p. xiv.</p>

The long-distance, international, and private correspondence network between the literary figures formed the basis for the concepts, <cite>Commonwealth of Learning</cite>; vernacular science-writing in Latin aimed at non-academic readers, as well as aiding the literary <q>underground</q> trade among researchers to propel theories and data collection, and the <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Letters' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105647/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Letters' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:47Z'>Republic of Letters</a></cite> (<abbr title='Republic of Letters'>ROL</abbr>) refers to a metaphysical <em>literary</em> society that produced and had access to substantial (non)scientific knowledge in Europe and America in the 17th century, p. 136-139.</p>

                      <p id='societal-circumstances'>Due to societal circumstances, eg. sponsorship and censorship by authorities, the literary underground with the help of the printing press was well underway in the 16th century. By 1640 <q>science had risen</q> mostly in the underground, and pre-dated the discovery and improvement of the telescope p. 685; the RoL; and the establishment of the RS. With the help of the RS later on, new discoveries and theories were disseminated abroad, p. 664.</p>

                      <p id='print-shifting-communication'>Eisenstein postulates that the printed book played a central role in the <q>rapid dissemination of knowledge to whole new classes that created the modern new attitudes to both science and religion at the end of the fifteenth century.</q> The mere availability of prior knowledge to the public, stimulated scientific curiosity further, and eventually gave birth to the scientific revolution, p. 691. Eisenstein also contends that the communication shift in technical literature occurred even before astronomers changed their views about the structure of the universe, p. 685. Moreover, the origins of the scientific revolution was partly due to the rediscovery of classical scientific texts, and the effects of an internal strife between academic innovators and conservationists (<q>quarrels of learned men</q>), trying to control the field of knowledge outside of academia, p. 523-524, 570. Eisenstein emphasises on the <q>relevance of external social institutions to the internal, relatively autonomous, life of science</q>, p. 636, as well as the utilitarian <q>application of the mathematics to the problems of the natural world</q>, p. 683.</p>

With this in mind, the most widely accepted purpose of a scholarly article is a way to communicate research results and other intellectual work with the public; to have an accurate archival record of the research findings; to build on top of earlier knowledge; as well as to have it serve towards crediting authors for their work. Today\u2019s scholarly journals, containing quality-controlled research reports, closely resemble the first journal. <cite><a rel='cito:obtainsBackgroundFrom' href='http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/773482913' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105651/https://www.worldcat.org/title/encyclopedia-of-international-media-and-communications-vol-2-f-k/oclc/773482913' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:51Z'>Encyclopedia of International Media and Communications</a></cite>, Scholarly Journals, Vol. 2, p. 688, 2003, states that due to the growth and demand for copies of the literature from non-members, mostly institutions, the larger journals began to sell subscriptions at relatively higher prices than members pay.</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><em>Communalism</em>: in order to promote collective collaboration, intellectual output should have common ownership.</li>
                    <li><em>Universalism</em>: scientific validity is kept independent of political and personal factors such that everyone has equal rights and possibility to obtain information.</li>
                    <li><em>Disinterestedness</em>: the practice of science should benefit the common scientific enterprise with no conflicts of individual interest or gain.</li>
                    <li><em>Organised skepticism</em>: scientific claims should be exposed to critical examination before being accepted to be part of common knowledge.</li>

                      <p>In order to open up access to scholarly journal literature, BOAI recommends the adoption of two complementary strategies for open access (<abbr title='Open Access'>OA</abbr>):</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Self-Archiving</li>

For OA-centric scientific literature, quality-control and certification are integral.</p>

                      <p id='oa-models-costs'>The foundations of the OA approach were conceived at a time when the major revenue models to cover publishing costs for scholarly literature were through subsidies from institutions, journal subscriptions, or pay-per-view. In this payment model, consumers of the literature were charged either individually or through institutions. In contrast, the <cite>article processing charge</cite> (<abbr title='Article Processing Charge'>APC</abbr>) model requires publication costs to be covered upfront, thereby waiving the costs for the consumers of the literature. Today, APC is the most widely used method to finance OA publishing, with varying levels of fees.

                        <li>cooperating agents can function without going through a central agency, eg. a <q>publisher</q>.</li>
                      </ol>

                      <p>The role of the journal includes both <q>main</q> (editorial, quality control, recognition of work, marketing, and disseminating) and <q>hidden</q> (subject and community defining, and archiving) functions. The proposed <em>deconstructed journal</em> model is preferable to the <q>paper</q> influenced electronic publishing model in that both main and hidden roles can be accomplished in a distributed manner. Here, Smith emphasises allowing greater academic freedom and shifting of power and control from the monolithic third-parties to the knowledge producers, which could be realised in either an <em>institution-</em> or <em>researcher-centric</em> approach. In this process, journals with the refereeing process would link to the articles with full content hosted on the authors\u2019 Web sites. To get there, however, Smith acknowledges that for such a new paradigm to be adopted, professional and funding bodies must transition themselves to accepting the decoupling and self-controlled literature publishing model as something equivalent (in terms of academic value) to the traditional model.</p>

                      <p id='grey-literature'>After two decades, the anecdotal evidence suggests that academia acknowledges the sort of equivalence that Smith describes at varying levels. For example, while literature quality-control can be generally anywhere on the Web, on the other hand, self-published literature remains to be treated as <q>grey literature</q>, that is, any material that is outside of the traditional scholarly distribution channels, especially when it comes to academic reward systems.</p>

The article echoes earlier work in that the scholarly journals bundle multiple functions, and that this tight coupling has hindered innovation, is inefficient, and makes it difficult to improve individual functions. The article also states that the current system, ie. the bundling of the closed publishing and certification models, is unlikely to change if the communication functions are not decoupled, regardless of all the other out-of-band activities \u2013 activism or innovation \u2013 to improve the publishing models or certification mechanisms.

The authors echo many of the ideas of Smith with respect to decoupling and decentralisation, however they only go as far as describing them within the context of scholarly functions operating alongside institutional or third-party online services. While the article does not exclude the possibility of units of information being self-hosted and individually-controlled by the researchers, it is not explored further. The article concludes that the nature of the communication revolution will be through the structure and organisation of the units in the system.</p>

                      <p id='open-science'>Today, <q>Open Science</q> is a broadly understood notion that is intended to foster an accessible approach to conducting science and scholarship. While there is no single agreed definition of open science, the general consensus is about improving the practice of scientific communication in a transparent, traceable, verifiable, and reusable manner. One definition of <q>open science</q> is as follows:</p>

However, it is not intended to be editable as the formatting instructions are no longer available.

Third-party scholarly publishers tend to require a fixed layout with typographical guidelines for research documents, hence submissions are often required to be made as PDFs.</p>

Authors may be unable to obtain or generate a precise identifier, or lack an authoring or referencing environment which would allow them to assign identifiers appropriately. When an author\u2019s intentions are preserved only in prose, entity-recognition techniques are typically required to understand the original intentions of citations. This is generally a complicated task and error prone given that an algorithm attempts to reverse-engineer the purpose of the citation.</p>

Depending on the one or more roles an actor has in the creation, editing, and republishing of content, the decision to create a new or reusing identifier is left as a judgement call.</p>

                      <p>Here I discuss a few systems that pertain to registration of identifiers:</p>

                      <p id='doi'><cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://doi.org/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190618082200/https://www.doi.org/' data-versiondate='2019-06-18T08:22:00Z'>Digital Object Identifier</a></cite> (<abbr title='Digital Object Identifier'>DOI</abbr>) is an international standard for document identification, and the services that are offered through <code>doi.org</code> is managed by the International DOI Foundation (at the time of this writing).

In order to have a resource assigned with a DOI, it has to be done by one of the DOI registration agencies which requires organisational membership, excluding individuals. For example, a typical journal publisher as a member of a DOI registration agency (eg. <cite><a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://www.crossref.org/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190618081912/https://www.crossref.org/' data-versiondate='2019-06-18T08:19:12Z'>CrossRef</a></cite>) submits mappings for objects of interest. Given the statement in AWWW, <q><a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#URI-persistence'>URI persistence is a matter of policy and commitment on the part of the URI owner</a></q>, DOI introduces an additional layer of social contract to govern the discovery of research artifacts. A DOI is aimed at being a persistent identifier for an object it is assigned to, and has the mechanism to refer to the URL of an object where it can be found. That is, a DOI may refer to a landing page about the actual object and not necessarily the object itself \u2013 this happens to be a common practice for literature that is not necessarily open and free. For literature that has restricted access, the resolved DOI is typically a webpage where an actor would need to go through the system\u2019s <q>paywall</q> or <q>access toll</q> in order to retrieve the content. From a machine\u2019s perspective, what the DOI identifies at the resolved location is not clear eg. company logo, tracking software, search form or the intended research object? For open literature, the resolved DOI would generally hyperlink to the actual scientific object in human-interpretable only fashion, or be part of a webpage accompanied by material unrelated to the scientific object itself, ie. information that the scientists neither assembled as part of their research nor intended for the consumer. If the actual URL of the object changes, the DOI\u2019s lookup table for the URL has to be updated. Otherwise, they'll point to dead links or unrelated information.</p>

An ORCID identifier is specified as a URI. While anyone can create and update their ORCID profile, the identifier is ultimately owned and managed by the ORCID organisation and made available through <code>orcid.org</code>. Profiles are constrained to express to the UI\u2019s template and the kind of information ORCID is willing to store. For most intents and purpose, the free service offered by ORCID is sufficient for researchers, and provides a mechanism where researchers can aggregate information about their education, employment, funding, and works like academic publications and data. It also allows researchers to extend their profile descriptions, as well as linking to their alternative online profiles.</p>

PURL, w3id, ORCID, and DOI are PIDs. For digital objects accessible over the Internet, PIDs are intended to be used as a long-lasting reference to a unit of information, and be <em>actionable</em> in the sense that the environment can be directed to the identified source. For example, a DOI-based PID can be <samp>10.2218/ijdc.v9i1.320</samp>, and the organisation \u2013 in this case the International DOI Foundation \u2013 would be responsible to maintain an unambiguous mapping to an accessible resource. Typically once mapped, the process starts from a DOI URI <samp>https://doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v9i1.320</samp> which (currently) resolves to the location <samp>http://www.ijdc.net/article/view/9.1.331</samp> where its contents can be retrieved.

                  <p><dfn id='ldn'>Linked Data Notifications (<abbr title='Linked Data Notifications'>LDN</abbr>)</dfn> is an HTTP-based protocol to facilitate exchanging messages between applications. LDN describes how servers (receivers) can receive messages pushed to them by applications (senders), as well as how other applications (consumers) may retrieve those messages. Any resource (target) can advertise a receiving endpoint (Inbox) for notification messages. Messages are expressed in RDF, and can contain arbitrary data. LDN is a <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709211912/https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:19:12Z'>W3C Recommendation</a></cite>.</p>

                  <p>LDN is defined using the following basic principles:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>The protocol is developed within the framework laid out by the <abbr title='Architecture of the World Wide Web'>AWWW</abbr>.</li>
                    <li>Interactions are designed to take place over HTTP.</li>
                    <li>Any Web resource may be the target of a notification.</li>
                    <li>Notifications may contain any data and use any Linked Data vocabulary.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <dl resource='#inbox-notification' rel='schema:hasPart' id='inbox-notification'>
                    <dt>Inbox</dt>
                    <dd rel='skos:hasTopConcept'>An <span typeof='skos:Concept' resource='#concept-scheme' rel='skos:topConceptOf' property='skos:prefLabel' id='concept-inbox' about='#concept-inbox'>inbox</span> is <span property='skos:definition' about='#concept-inbox'>a container or directory (attached to a Web resource) which is used to store and serve a collection of notifications.</span></dd>

                    <dt>Notification</dt>
                    <dd rel='skos:hasTopConcept'>A <span typeof='skos:Concept' resource='#concept-scheme' rel='skos:topConceptOf' property='skos:prefLabel' id='concept-notification' about='#concept-notification'>notification</span> is <span property='skos:definition' about='#concept-notification'>a retrievable resource in an inbox which returns content expressed in RDF. The contents of notifications are intended to describe a change in state of some other resource, or contain new information for the attention of a user or process, and may be subject to constraints of the Inbox it is contained in.</span></dd>
                  </dl>

                  <p id='design-intent'>We designed the LDN protocol to support sharing and reuse of notifications <em>across</em> applications, regardless of how they were generated or what their contents are. I describe how the principles of identification, addressability and semantic representation can be applied to notifications on the Web. Specifying LDN as a formal protocol allows independently implemented, heterogeneous applications which generate and use notifications, to seamlessly work together. Thus, LDN supports the decentralisation of the Web as well as encourages the generation and consumption of Linked Data.</p>

                  <p id='design-decision'>LDN is built on existing W3C standards and Linked Data principles. In particular, the storage of notifications is compatible with the <cite>Linked Data Platform</cite> specification; notifications are identified by HTTP URIs; and notification contents are available as JSON-LD (or other RDF syntaxes as per content-negotiation). A key architectural decision is the separation of concerns between <em>senders</em>, <em>receivers</em>, and <em>consumers</em> of notifications. Implementations of the protocol can play one or more of these roles, and interoperate successfully with implementations playing the complementary roles. This means that notifications generated by one application can be reused by a completely different application, accessed via the store where the notification data resides, through shared Linked Data vocabularies. LDN also pushes the decentralised approach further by allowing any <em>target</em> resource to advertise its Inbox anywhere on the Web; that is, targets do not need to be coupled with or controlled by a receiver operating from the same server, and can make use of a third-party <em>inbox-as-a-service</em>.</p>

                  <p>Beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia, LDN senders and consumers need little to no prior knowledge about how to interact with receivers. Furthermore, senders and consumers determine a target\u2019s inbox location dynamically. This design approach is aligned with the notion of <a href='#self-describing'>self-describing resources</a> in that applications are only required to identify a particular relation indicating the inbox location, and perform a <cite><a href='#follow-your-nose'>follow your nose</a></cite> type of exploration. Given that a target\u2019s preferred inbox location may change at their discretion, applications can be adaptive in inbox discovery.</p>

                    <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                      <p>The data formats which are used by a notification specification must be chosen to maximise interoperability between implementations. <cite>Structure of Scholarly Information</cite> makes the argument for using <a href='#rdf-as-the-language'>RDF as the language</a> to express human- and machine-readable information on the Web. Allowing LDN actors \u2013 senders, receivers, and consumers \u2013 to handle data irrespective of the particular RDF serialisation permits flexibility, however it can also be costly to support. We take into account:</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li><em>Application interoperability</em> eg. should applications support all current RDF formats, as well as new versions or formats in the future?</li>
                        <li><em>Maintenance of RDF parsers and serialisation libraries</em> eg. will the RDF libraries that applications use be kept up to date?</li>
                        <li><em>Complexity of their inclusion in applications</em> eg. what are the costs or concerns of using all RDF formats?</li>
                        <li><em>Run-time efficiency</em> eg. how well will applications perform going forward?</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p><strong>Why JSON-LD</strong>: To address these issues, choosing a single RDF serialisation to <em>require</em> is necessary for consistent interoperability, as well as keeping processing requirements or external code dependencies minimal. While any RDF notation would satisfy that need, we decided that LDN requires all applications to create and understand the JSON-LD syntax, both for the contents of Inbox as well as for individual notifications.</p>

                      <p>To some extent, JSON-LD is compatible with existing JSON libraries or in some cases native programming language data structures. For example, Web browsers have a built-in interpreter for JavaScript that can handle JSON objects, that can take advantage of native object operations. Same data processing and manipulation operations are also available in a Node.js environment. Having said that, JSON-LD is a format that serves to be an RDF notation, and can also be processed as plain JSON. Hence, JSON-LD is just one convenience to certain kinds of environments that the application is confined to. JSON-LD is also advantageous in being familiar for developers who are <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='http://manu.sporny.org/2014/json-ld-origins-2/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190405035404/http://manu.sporny.org/2014/json-ld-origins-2/' data-versiondate='2019-04-05T03:54:04Z'>used to JSON-based APIs but not RDF</a></cite>.</p>

                      <p><strong>Content negotiation</strong>: Optionally, applications may attempt to exchange different RDF serialisations by performing <strong>content negotiation</strong>. As in compliance with HTTP principles, a sender may make an <code>HTTP OPTIONS</code> request to the receiver to determine the RDF content types accepted by the server. A receiver can expose <code>Accept-Post</code> headers for senders, and so the sender can serialize the notification in the request body accordingly. Consumers can send <code>Accept</code> headers to receivers to signal which RDF content types they prefer and capable of processing.</p>

                      <p>By mandating one RDF syntax (JSON-LD) for applications to communicate with, as well as permitting other syntaxes to discover and exchange notifications, compatibility across applications is assured.</p>

                      <p id='target-ownership'><strong>Target ownership</strong>: As per AWWW\u2019s <cite>URI Ownership</cite>, the Inbox is ultimately controlled by the owner of LDN Receiver, and subject to third-party access to HTTP headers and content. Hence, publishers of the resources advertising an Inbox (target) are expected to be aware of using servers they trust or control for the Inbox location.</p>

                      <p id='constraints'><strong>Constraints</strong>: One way to filter unwarranted notifications from being created on the server and exposed is where Inbox URLs announce their own constraints eg. <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212253/https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:53Z'>Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)</a></cite>, <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://shexspec.github.io/spec/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212253/https://shexspec.github.io/spec/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:53Z'>ShEx</a></cite>, Web Annotation Protocol, via an HTTP <code>Link</code> header or body of the resource with a <code>rel</code> value of <code>ldp:constrainedBy</code>. For example, an LDN receiver may want to allow notifications with a certain shape; a model specifying allowed and required values in a notification. This is so that senders can comply with the advertised constraint specification or the receiver may reject their notification. Rejecting notifications which do not match a specific pattern in their contents, or the <em>shape</em> of the data, is one way to filter. For example, if the Inbox owner knows that they will only ever use a consuming application which processes friend requests, they can configure their receiver to filter out anything that does not match the pattern for a friend request, helping their consumer to be more efficient. If the notification constraints are also advertised by the receiving service as structured descriptions, generation and consumption of the notifications can be further automated. Constraints are particularly useful towards providing notifications that meets a certain criteria so that it can be used effectively by consuming applications.</p>

                      <p id='authenticated-inboxes'><strong>Authenticated inboxes</strong>: The requirement for reusable notifications could be seen as a potential risk for privacy. The LDN Receivers are expected to consider implementing access control on the Inbox URL as well as the individual notification URL and may restrict reading and writing to a whitelist of trusted senders. Various authentication methods which could be used alongside LDN with the idea that notifications are not necessarily public but only visible or reusable by intended parties. The receivers decide (based on their use case) which consumers (based on any criteria) can reuse. They achieve this by setting authentication and authorization settings on the notifications. As  different authentication mechanisms are appropriate for different applications, the notification protocol should ideally be usable alongside various methods such as clientside certificates, eg. WebID+TLS, token-based, eg. OAuth 2.0, or digital signatures.</p>

                      <p id='personally-identifiable-information'><strong>Personally identifiable information</strong>: Notification payloads may contain any data including that which identifies the sender or the receiver. As access to the Inbox and notification data is under the control of the receiver, they ultimately determine what information may be exposed to the world. Once fetched by a third-party, any piece of information could potentially be subject to further (unauthorised) distribution and reuse. Hence, this is orthogonal to whether the notifications are ephemeral or persistent.</p>

ARIA helps to inform consuming assistive technologies such as screen magnifiers, screen readers, text-to-speech software, speech recognition software, alternate input technologies, and alternate pointing devices to create a particular accessibility tree, and to adapt the user interface to a form that works for the person, eg. a screen-reader can read the menu items, or selected option is receiving keyboard focus.

        "\n                      <p>The mechanism for personal identities, social graphs, and self-publishing articles and annotations enables a new layer of decentralised interactions. Here I describe how actors can discover units of information created or annotated in response to Web resources (like articles) by their social network without intermediaries (which includes the authors of the article or the features supported by the server it is published at).

This further decouples the components required to publish and consume content on the Web in an interoperable way. The decentralised activities in dokieli demonstrates the utility of independent publishing, semantic relations, as well as extensibility of structured Web objects.</p>\n                    "^^rdf:HTML;

As for <a href='#persistence-and-retrievability'>persistence and retrievability</a>, any consumer application can potentially benefit from being able to reuse notifications if the owners of a receiver makes the necessary commitments. There are further considerations which may be of interest to implementers, or may constitute future work around extending the core protocol, which are worth outlining here.</p>\n\n                      <p id='subscribing-to-notifications'><strong>Subscribing to Notifications</strong>: The interaction between consumers and receivers describes a <em>pull</em> mechanism. A <cite><a href='#subscribing'>subscribing</a></cite> mechanism in which consumers <em>request</em> that receivers <em>push</em> content changes to them is left out of scope. Much of the related work <em>requires</em> notifications to be explicitly solicited to trigger sending. Since in a decentralised model, receivers may not be aware of possible sources for notifications, our sender-receiver relationship depends on the sender\u2019s autonomy to make such decisions by itself. This does not preclude the scenario in which a receiver may wish to solicit notifications from a particular sender, but as there are already <em>subscription</em> mechanisms in wide use on the Web eg. ActivityPub, WebSub, <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212256/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:56Z'>The WebSocket Protocol</a></cite> (<abbr title='The WebSocket Protocol'>RFC 6455</abbr>), <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8030' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212256/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8030' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:56Z'>Generic Event Delivery Using HTTP Push</a></cite> (<abbr title='Generic Event Delivery Using HTTP Push'>RFC 8030</abbr>), and can be interoperably combined with LDN, we do not need to specify it as part of our protocol. A push based interaction can still be arranged between LDN applications, where it would be implementation specific. For example, in a notification, a sender specifies the location of an inbox where it can receive updates about content changes. Then, an application that consumes the notifications manages its own subscriber list, and takes the role of sender in order to push content to the inbox as specified in the notification. Another specification-level integration of LDN pertaining to subscribing is that ActivityPub\u2019s <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#follow-activity-inbox' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212236/https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:36Z'>Follow Activity</a></cite> is a notification requesting to be notified of target\u2019s activities when they are created.

The server then dispatches notifications to the inboxes of these actors.</p>\n\n                      <p id='semantic-organisation-of-notifications'><strong>Semantic Organisation of Notifications</strong>: While LDN facilitates a decentralised architecture for notification exchange, it does not prescribe the structure and semantics of the notifications themselves. The composition of the notifications are unspecified to foster different kinds of applications to be built to communicate information in any domain. Consequently, organisation of notification models materialises through the fact that domain-centric applications create and consume what is meaningful to them in order to coordinate among themselves. So while the notification system is globally decentralised, it enables communication that can be specialised and be only useful and meaningful to applications that understands a particular message\u2019s semantics.</p>\n\n                      <p id='inbox-paging'><strong>Inbox Paging</strong>: We need to consider both the needs of software systems and humans when large amounts of notification data are being generated and shared between diverse applications which may be operating without knowledge of each other. To organise and manage large amount of notifications over time, mechanisms should be in place to break representations of collections of notifications into multiple paged responses that may be easier to consume by applications.</p>\n\n                      <p id='updating-and-deleting-notifications'><strong>Updating and Deleting Notifications</strong>: Receivers may want to carry out resource management or garbage collection, or permit consumers or other applications to do so. For example, an application to consume messages might let an authenticated and authorised user \u2018mark as read\u2019 by adding a triple to the inbox or notification contents.</p>\n\n                      <p id='social-implications'><strong>Social Implications</strong>: In an ecosystem where anyone can (technically) say anything about anything, we can acknowledge the social challenges surrounding that in context of notifications. As the LDN protocol facilitates distribution and discovery of information, it can amplify misinformation and (community-centric) inappropriate content, as well as online and offline social dangers effectively. That is, consumers of notifications can be exposed to such information if an inbox is not managed properly. LDN may offer one way to mitigate this problem in that, the actors that control an inbox can decide on which notifications can persist and which to be removed, thereby one way to eliminate references to undesirable content created by other parties. At the same time, the same privilege can also be used to filter information and have bias towards certain parties. This is a form of decentralised curation in that while no single inbox can oversee the discovery of a resource (as there are alternative ways), it enables the owners of receivers to exert their authority on the notifications that makes it into their system. It is a middle-ground in that, on one hand, individuals can voice themselves by registering and making their resources accessible, owners of inboxes can choose not to provide pointers to it. I will further revisit some of these concerns in <cite><a href='#addressing-social-implications'>Addressing Social Implications</a></cite>.</p>\n                    "^^rdf:HTML;

:affordance
    schema:description
        "Hypertext has perceivable affordances in that both humans and machines can choose to act. For example, when a Web document is presented with a hyperlink, its users have the option to follow the link, if they so desire, by pressing a key on their keyboard, clicking on it with their pointing-device, or with voice activation and so on. Hovering a link with the cursor can trigger the Web browser to display the full target URL in the status bar of the application, and hence informing the user on what lies ahead before engaging further. If the user is already familiar with the link (visited earlier) or uninterested, they can skip. The interaction with the hypertext is in essence non-linear, ie. we can follow the links as far as we are able to, or interested, and then come back to where we started. Similarly, machines, like Web-crawlers are able to perform exactly the same process. Moreover, hyperlinks marked up with specific relations to their target reference can signal information that can effectively induce unique interactions. In that respect, RDFa in HTML for instance can help enrich and enable the structure for different interaction possibilities, for example though runtime JavaScript or the Web browser\u2019s built-in understanding of the underlying actions. With respect to scholarly referencing, hypertext can not only reference other resources \u2013 as typical to print-based expressions \u2013 but it can also link."^^rdf:HTML;

                      <p>Annotation of artifacts facilitates a social behaviour in that it is a collaborative effort: some actors create primary resources while others create associations between those resources, add new information, or extend existing information. Consequently, such activities help actors to learn, discover or explore new knowledge. Annotations of analogue as well as digital resources have been historically essential to sociality, education, stronger engagement, as well as being a valid form of user-generated content as per background provided in <cite><a rel='cito:obtainsBackgroundFrom' href='http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november08/gazan/11gazan.html' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190502152743/http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november08/gazan/11gazan.html' data-versiondate='2019-05-02T15:27:43Z'>Social Annotations in Digital Library Collections</a></cite>, Gazan, 2008.</p>

                      <p>A Web Annotation can be created to associate a node or a selection with a particular user motivation. The annotation can be registered and stored as a unit of information at actor\u2019s <cite><a href='#profile-storage'>storage</a></cite>, <cite><a href='#profile-index'>type index location</a></cite>, <cite><a href='#profile-outbox'>outbox</a></cite>, or article\u2019s <cite><a href='#subject-annotation-service'>annotation service</a></cite>. The users can provide a text note for their annotations, assign a <cite><a href='#license'>license</a></cite>, as well as designate an <cite><a href='#subject-inbox'>inbox</a></cite> for their annotation, so that it can receive its own notifications. The Table on WA motivations includes the method applied, location of the annotation, and associated notification.</p>

                      <p>Once an annotation is created and has a dereferenceable HTTP URI (subject to access control rules), a notification can be sent to the inbox of the target resource about the annotation if any part of an article advertises an LDN inbox. Depending on the motivation of the annotation, the notification is modelled with the <cite>Activity vocabulary</cite> eg. the <a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-create'>Create</a> activity (<code>as:Create</code>), to indicate that the actor has created the object.</p>

                      <p>In order to discover and view previously created annotations associated with an article, dokieli follows LDN\u2019s discovery mechanism for notifications about annotations, and then subsequently fetches the annotations in order to display them in context of their target selector.</p>

                          <p>The Web architecture permits agents to communicate through different protocols eg. HTTP, FTP, SMTP are application layer protocols in the <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105642/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:42Z'>Internet Protocol Suite</a></cite> (<abbr title='Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Application and Support'>RFC 1123</abbr>). In this thesis, the focus is on HTTP for data communication, ie. the structured requests and responses exchanged by Web agents. For example, when a <em>user-agent</em> (like a Web browser) initiates a request to access the contents of a resource identified by an HTTP URI (<em>dereferencing</em>), a server responds with a message body including a representation of the resource state, and data about the response. The content of the response URL (HTTP URI) is a particular state in that it has a presentation and controls (affordances) that can be further engaged with, eg. hyperlinks to follow; data forms that can be submitted; location of alternate representations. One particular description of this interaction is given in 2000 by Fielding, in <cite><a rel='cito:obtainsBackgroundFrom' href='http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105643/https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:43Z'>Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a></cite>, commonly referred to as <cite>Representational State Transfer</cite> (<abbr title='Representational State Transfer'>REST</abbr>): a set of architectural constraints for distributed hypermedia systems. There are diverse Web agents, eg. browsers, servers, autonomous scripts, with different capabilities, hence as per <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105642/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:42Z'>HTTP/1.1 Message Syntax and Routing</a></cite> (<abbr title='Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing'>RFC 7230</abbr>), not all agents are expected to make the same interactions that are presented to them.</p>

                          <p id='safe-interactions'>There are two categories of interactions: safe and unsafe. A <dfn>safe interaction</dfn> is one where the requested resource\u2019s state does not change. When an agent makes a retrieval request (<code>HTTP GET</code>), it has no obligation beyond dereferencing the URL. An <dfn>unsafe interaction</dfn> on the other hand may cause a resource to change its state, and that the user may be held accountable, depending on the semantics of the interaction. For example, an agent sending an <code>HTTP POST</code> request with a payload can get a response indicating that a new resource was created, that the resource represented by the URI was deleted by an <code>HTTP DELETE</code> request, or that the agent is unauthorised to either create or delete the resource.</p>

                          <p id='representations'>When a client requests a resource, the server may return a <em>particular</em> representation of a resource that is the result of a "negotiation" between them. For example, a client may indicate that it would accept the resource in HTML, Turtle, and JSON-LD data formats, and in English and Armenian languages. The server could provide a response body using HTML and English.</p>

                          <p id='http-request-response-functions'>HTTP request and response functions can be expressed as follows:</p>

                          <p>The Web architecture permits agents to communicate through different protocols eg. HTTP, FTP, SMTP are application layer protocols in the <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105642/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:42Z'>Internet Protocol Suite</a></cite> (<abbr title='Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Application and Support'>RFC 1123</abbr>). In this thesis, the focus is on HTTP for data communication, ie. the structured requests and responses exchanged by Web agents. For example, when a <em>user-agent</em> (like a Web browser) initiates a request to access the contents of a resource identified by an HTTP URI (<em>dereferencing</em>), a server responds with a message body including a representation of the resource state, and data about the response. The content of the response URL (HTTP URI) is a particular state in that it has a presentation and controls (affordances) that can be further engaged with, eg. hyperlinks to follow; data forms that can be submitted; location of alternate representations. One particular description of this interaction is given in 2000 by Fielding, in <cite><a rel='cito:obtainsBackgroundFrom' href='http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105643/https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:43Z'>Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a></cite>, commonly referred to as <cite>Representational State Transfer</cite> (<abbr title='Representational State Transfer'>REST</abbr>): a set of architectural constraints for distributed hypermedia systems.

                          <p id='safe-interactions'>There are two categories of interactions: safe and unsafe. A <dfn>safe interaction</dfn> is one where the requested resource\u2019s state does not change. When an agent makes a retrieval request (<code>HTTP GET</code>), it has no obligation beyond dereferencing the URL. An <dfn>unsafe interaction</dfn> on the other hand may cause a resource to change its state, and that the user may be held accountable, depending on the semantics of the interaction. For example, an agent sending an <code>HTTP POST</code> request with a payload can get a response indicating that a new resource was created, that the resource represented by the URI was deleted by an <code>HTTP DELETE</code> request, or that the agent is unauthorised to either create or delete the resource.</p>

                          <p id='representations'>When a client requests a resource, the server may return a <em>particular</em> representation of a resource that is the result of a "negotiation" between them. For example, a client may indicate that it would accept the resource in HTML, Turtle, and JSON-LD data formats, and in English and Armenian languages. The server could provide a response body using HTML and English.</p>

In the case of standards compliance, well-formed and valid markup ensures internal integrity of Web documents. As for better accessibility, incorporating WCAG where applicable can help user-agents, including text-only Web browsers, Web crawlers, and other agents with minimal capabilities to parse and render content. With respect to traditional Web documents, the information that is visible, observable, or human-readable from HTML is considered to set the lowest barrier to obtain content.

For example, resources referring to external scripts may load unsuccessfully given that their own independent availability. Authors refer to the notion of <q>deferred representations</q> where the final state of a resource is when all code and events have finished executing. Hence, representations rely on JavaScript to fully render do not serve well for archival crawlers that are unequipped to handle JavaScript. On the other hand, certain archival services include a feature known as <em>headless browser</em> that is capable of processing the resource similar to common GUI-based Web browsers with JavaScript enabled, and thus capturing the final state of the representation once all scripts are executed. This too however may be problematic for content that dynamically changes based on the instructions of the script. For example, a script that presents temporal content may be different at each time the archived resource is recalled.</p>

                  <p id='trust'>Trust is ultimately tied to verifiable claims about identity and their provenance. While the creation and protection of third-party controlled online identities have received much focus, claiming and using personal identities online is still a challenge. Today\u2019s Web applications predominantly make use of online identities that are essentially tied to and controlled by authorities in which users are merely borrowing an identifier and its management. It is a common practice to where users are required to create accounts at each online service they wish to use, eg. social media sites. Moreover, the trust model of such design dictates claims and usage of online identities is not ultimately in the hands of the users, and can be taken away from the users by the owners of the URIs and service at any time and reason. Even in cases where third-party issues identities can be used across different services, it is subject to a privacy violation as the identity provider essentially gets to know which services the user\u2019s online identity is used with and for what purpose. Consequently such services can gradually build up information about users\u2019 actions as well as behavioural patterns on the Web. Lastly, portability and interoperability of the identities is generally under developed as there is no particular incentive for an identity provider to make it so \u2013 after all, providing \u201cfree\u201d services for online identities, and then locking identities to well-defined circle of services is taken advantage of by large corporations given their business models. Perhaps most importantly, such online services (as well as applications) do not recognise the identity of users as a distinct notion from the applications and services they use towards authentication.</p>

For authentication, public key verifies that a holder of the paired private key sent the message.

As the extension mechanism in X.509 allows additional statements to be specified under the <code>Subject Alternative Name</code> (<abbr title='Subject Alternative Name'>SAN</abbr>) field, it is used to declare the user\u2019s WebID for the <code>URI</code> field. When a client application running on the Web browser requests a resource from the server, the TLS connection gets established between them. Once TLS has been set up, the HTTP application protocol exchange takes place (eg. <code>HTTP GET</code>, <code>HTTP POST</code>). If the requested resource requires WebID authentication the server can request the client to authenticate itself. When the Web browser encounters this certificate request, it may prompt its user to choose a certificate (from its certificate manager) \u2013 thereby signing a token with its private key \u2013 to let the client send it to the server. The verification agent extracts the public key as well as the WebID from the certificate. As the WebID enables a global dereferencing mechanism for finding a key, the server uses can decide on dereferencing the WebID Profile and verify the claims about the WebID. Once the identity verification is established, the server can look up its access control rules for the requested resource to determine if and how the request can be fulfilled. Researchers can use servers and applications implementing the WebID-TLS workflow towards securely identifying profile claims and to have access to resources may be otherwise protected.</p>

    schema:description
        "\n                      <p>Today it would be difficult to think of a Web without social functions. Perhaps the Web\u2019s support and ability to facilitate social interactions \u2013 above anything else \u2013 contributed to the transformation of societies in the last quarter century. The Web, as a medium, expedited all patterns of social interrelationships in a manner that can be more efficiently documented, discovered and reused. It necessitates that system designs should be inclusive and facilitate <em>involvement</em> within the range of an actor\u2019s autonomy. Furthermore, actors should be able to use socially-aware decentralised applications that can perform the core functions in scholarly communications \u2013 registration, awareness, certification, and archiving.</p>\n\n                      <p>The systems that are designed to fulfill the functions in scholarly communication should operate with the expectation of autonomous participation. One value that can be upheld through the principle of autonomy is to not have any constraints on where units of communication can exist on the Web. For instance, the actors of a system can have the freedom to designate identifiers to their artifacts: profile(s), articles, annotations, notifications, data, and so forth, as well as where they can be retrieved from. Similarly, the actor\u2019s autonomy to use preferred applications to interact with data. The <em>decentralisation</em> of the information space is <em>a</em> means to gain autonomy on the Web. With respect to <em>delocalisation</em>, units of information, eg. personal Web identifiers (WebID) controlled by their owners, can be used across different systems as they need not be tied to any particular URI space or system, and are free from external influences. Ultimately, autonomy is the right to freely choose and maintain sovereignty over URI ownership and data spaces, and the ability to use or switch between applications that can interact with them. Likewise, actors\u2019 autonomy would not obstruct them to use shared URI spaces if they so desire.</p>\n\n                      <p>Any type of object, eg. scientific literature, research objects, personal websites, profiles and social graphs, can be made available on the Web provided that the <em>actors</em> have sufficient control over their URIs, or delegate to entities they trust. Through URI ownership, deconstructing and decoupling of resources can take place.</p>\n\n                      <p>The contents of HTTP URLs may be logically centralised or decentralised. For example, the media representations found at the URL can embed compound or dynamic components that are dependent on external (remote) URLs. In this particular case, the persistence of the external URLs, as well as whether their contents are immutable is a design concern.</p>\n\n                      <blockquote cite='http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/'>\n                        <h6>Article 19.</h6>\n\n                        <p>Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.</p>\n\n                        <footer><cite><a rel='cito:includesQuotationFrom' href='http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212312/https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:12Z'>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a></cite>, United Nations</footer>\n                      </blockquote>\n\n                      <p>Autonomy is an important ingredient to fully exercise <em>freedom of expression</em>, which is a civil liberty. If a URI is governed by a third-party entity, ie. other than the researcher who shares the contents of a scientific resource, then it is possible that the URLs may no longer resolve, and the content may be subject to change in ways beyond researcher\u2019s control. Whereas without intermediaries, the researcher has sufficient access and control as to what happens at their URI space. This gives actors the ability to exercise <em>self-registration</em> with respect to the registration function. Trust in this case may be placed on the Web space that is closer to the owner and publisher of the URI.</p>\n\n                      <p>The right to have <em>freedom of expression</em> necessitates that the articulation of scholarly contributions are not subject to arbitrary interference from third-parties, and allow actors to seek the most appropriate ways to co-create and co-participate. We inherit:</p>\n\n                      <p id='freedom-of-expression-constraints'>Freedom of expression in context of academic communication does not entail that any arbitrary artifact eg. self-published articles, passes quality-control and certification from the community, or ethically appropriate. By free expression, I mean that actors should not be subject to <em>technical constraints</em> on how they communicate their discoveries and knowledge with the rest of the world. That is, to have the means to <em>shape</em> machine-readable structure and semantics, presentations, and interactions. Enrolling in the certification process of some literature can for instance mean that reviewers may engage in any aspect and granularity of the contribution itself, eg. a weakness for an argument in one literature can be contrasted (and linked) with a scientific result presented in another literature. Academic freedom to express entails that researchers caring out their work comply with discipline-specific methods and meet standards related to accuracy, precision, completeness, reliability, relevance, and so forth. Furthermore, as with human rights, the ability to express does not grant unethical practices at the expense of any person or group. Technical expressions that are harmful or discriminatory, eg. inaccessible content, constrained presentations, or undesirable user interactions, should be avoided.</p>\n\n                      <p>The concerns about authenticity, persistence and permanence of data and knowledge is constant regardless of where the resources reside on the Web. Hence, strictly trusting scholarly knowledge based on its registered location is ultimately fragile in that it is unavoidable to prevent all sorts of threats to preservation in a long enough timeline. However, since the registration function is decoupled from archiving, we are able to delegate that trust to a third-party that is best fit to handle the preservation and to some extent guarantee the authenticity of the units of communication. This is particularly important as archival and trust are part of the global scholarly commons.</p>\n\n                      <p>In context of the Web, technical or social decentralisation at all levels is unattainable. Even open Web standards are based on social and technical decisions, and can be seen as a form of centralisation in that conforming systems cluster and coordinate among themselves. Similarly, centralisation naturally occurs in social systems like concepts or language, eg. machine-readable vocabularies restrict the set of uses of a system. The alternative pushed to the extreme where each unit is expressed in their own language and without any language mapping, puts us in a situation similar to that of the <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212311/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:11Z'>Tower of Babel</a></cite>, ie. being incapable of understanding each other. Hence, autonomy in a system where researchers are isolated or information is not interpretable renders freedom of expression meaningless.</p>\n\n                      <p typeof='skos:Concept' resource='#self-publishing' rel='cito:discusses' id='self-publishing'><strong property='skos:prefLabel'>Self-publishing</strong>: <span property='skos:definition'>In context of <cite><a rel='cito:extends' href='#degree-of-control'>Degree of Control</a></cite>, <em>self-publishing</em> entails that an actor can register identifiers for their content, shape and store data where they have access to, set access control policies, and use preferred applications to achieve them.</span></p>\n                    "^^rdf:HTML;

                      <p>To this end, LORC, as a unit of communication, advertises its <em>inbox</em> to receive <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709211912/https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:19:12Z'>Linked Data Notifications</a></cite> about scholarly activities, eg. publication of scholarly articles, <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212308/https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:08Z'>Web Annotations</a></cite> (eg. assessments, replies), citations, call for contributions, proceedings, scientific observations and workflows, arguments, funding, decisions, and so forth.

                  <section resource='#linked-specifications-reports' rel='schema:hasPart' inlist='' id='linked-specifications-reports'>
                    <h4 property='schema:name'>Linked Specifications, Test Suites, and Implementation Reports</h4>
                    <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                      <p>To demonstrate the extensibility of units of communication within the frame of Linked Research, I extend the LDN <cite><a href='#test-suite-and-implementation-reports'>Test Suite and Implementation Reports</a></cite> and <cite><a href='#linked-data-notifications-implementations'>Implementations</a></cite> and describe the development of an interlinked, human- and machine-readable W3C Recommendation, its test suite, and implementation reports as a whole.</p>

                      <p>The missing connection among existing specifications and test reports is that a uniform resource discovery is not possible between the test reports and the individual conformance criteria in the specifications, where a given information at a particular URL is both human- and machine-processable (see <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsDataSource' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-specifications-reports#related-work' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212249/https://csarven.ca/linked-specifications-reports' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:49Z'>Linked Specifications, Test Suites, and Implementation Reports Related Work</a></cite>.)</p>

                      <p>Having the specifications and implementation reports interlinked and retrievable can facilitate their automated discovery and reuse. One use case is to be able to find applications that match a certain conformance criteria, eg. in order to have fine-grained bundling of software packages. While this would typically include "normative requirements", tests can potentially capture and reveal optional features of specifications. Prospective consumers of the compliance reports can be application developers finding appropriate software for use, as well as automatic software package managers.</p>

                      <p>The following figure <cite><a href='#figure-linked-specifications-reports'>Linked Specifications Reports</a></cite> depicts an overview of linking the LDN specification, its test suite, the generated implementation report for the dokieli project, reports summary, and an article citing the specification.</p>

                      <figure resource='#figure-linked-specifications-reports' rel='schema:hasPart' id='figure-linked-specifications-reports'>
                        <object width='640' type='image/svg+xml' rel='schema:image' height='427' data='https://csarven.ca/media/images/articles/linked-specifications-reports.svg'></object>

                        <figcaption property='schema:name'>An overview of linking a specification, test suite, generated implementation report for the project, reports summary, and an article citing the specification</figcaption>
                      </figure>

                      <p>The information patterns in the LDN <a href='#a-decentralised-notifications-protocol'>specification</a> and the <a href='#test-suite-and-implementation-reports'>implementation reports</a> sections are reusable across other specifications and related components. Sources are available from:</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>The specification: <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/'>https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/</a></li>
                        <li>The test suite: <a href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/'>https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/</a></li>
                        <li>Implementation reports summary and individual reports: <a href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/summary'>https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/summary</a></li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>The test suite uses the <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://github.com/csarven/mayktso' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212253/https://github.com/csarven/mayktso' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:53Z'>mayktso</a></cite> server as the LDN receiver, but any conformant receiver implementation will work here.</p>

                      <p>The notifications carrying the reports have an HTML+RDFa representation (alternatively in other RDF serialisations upon content negotiation). The scholarly article on <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212249/https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:49Z'>Linked Data Notifications</a></cite> uses the <cite>CiTO</cite> vocabulary to cite the specification with <code>cito:citesAsAuthority</code>. Another peer reviewed article, <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/dokieli-rww' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212314/https://csarven.ca/dokieli-rww' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:14Z'>Decentralised Authoring, Annotations and Notifications for a Read-Write Web with dokieli</a></cite>, contextually cites the specification with <code>cito:citesAsPotentialSolution</code> from its <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/dokieli-rww#architectural-overview'>architectural overview</a> section, as well as the LDN Test Suite with <code>cito:citesAsAuthority</code> from its <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/dokieli-rww#adoption'>adoption</a> section. This is useful in that we can have articles linked to what is already available with minimal effort. Including this article that you are currently reading and interacting with.</p>

                      <p>The realisation here is that we have everything operating in a way that is interoperable: the specification, test suite, discovery of the reports, and academic articles, all reusing existing vocabularies.</p>

LDN is the only mechanism which describes the Consumer (C) role; this explicitly highlights how notifications can be useful to applications other than those concerned with sending and receiving. For mechanisms which include a Subscriber (U) role, the Receiver (R) is essentially also the Consumer, so Receivers are less generic and require specialised payloads. In this respect, LDN is a more modular specification. LDN Receivers need not be concerned with additional actions beyond storing and exposing notifications; complex and domain-specific uses of the notifications are left to Consumers, resulting in a lot more flexibility in terms of lightweight end-user applications.</p>\n\n                      <p>WebSub differs in terms of the number of roles, but not the actual functions of the specified roles. The hub is an intermediate party which plays the role of a Receiver and a Sender, relaying notifications from the original Sender (or publisher) to the Subscriber (or ultimate Receiver), but nonetheless only makes notifications available to the Subscriber and no other applications.</p>\n\n                      <p>LDN enforces that notifications should be reusable, and specifies how Receivers should make notifications available for Consumers. The other mechanisms either consider notification reuse as inapplicable or leave it optional and unspecified.</p>\n\n                      <p>This is also tied to to persistence and retrievability in that LDN requires notifications to be identified by dereferenceable HTTP URIs. The other notification mechanisms treat notifications as ephemeral resources which only exist until they are delivered to a Receiver.</p>\n\n                      <p>The mechanisms with the <em>fat ping</em> approach require structured data in XML or JSON-LD. Only LDN requires the use of RDF through JSON-LD, and optional content negotiation for other RDF syntaxes. Thus, notification payloads can include references to other retrievable resources, or can embed all relevant data directly in the payload.</p>\n\n                      <p>Approaches which send only URLs (as with linkback) rely on the receiver interpreting a third-party resource, which may or may not contain structured content or be under the control of the sender. Approaches which offer additional guidance to aid the receiver in interpreting the source document(s) nonetheless still restrict the sender. LDN therefore offers flexibility to senders, increasing the potential uses for the notification mechanism. LDN compensates for increased complexity on the receiver\u2019s end by recommending filtering mechanisms, and moving most of the burden of understanding notification contents to the consumer role. In placing no constraints on the notification payload, LDN enables a sender to be precise and lossless with the data it is transmitting. As such LDN can cover a broader variety of use cases.</p>\n\n                      <p>LDN recommends that Receiver applications perform some processing of the payload. This is to enable users to configure their Receivers to filter out spam or customise them for particular domains, but is not required; such filtering could also be left to or supplemented by Consumers. In contrast, Semantic Pingback and Webmention require receivers to parse the form-encoded payload and then to perform fetching of the URLs within and additional parsing of the documents those URLs identify. This is required in order to verify the message (by finding the target URL). Such processing in LDN is left at the discretion of the Receiver; linkback style verification is not required, but also not forbidden. </p>\n\n                      <p>As WebSub requires subscribing as part of its core design, hubs are expected to perform specific actions on receipt of a <em>subscription</em> request (where the payload is tightly constrained), but not necessarily to process the contents of a notification sent by a <em>publisher</em> (where the payload can be anything; how they handle this depends on the content-type). </p>\n\n                      <p>Though LDN does not specify a subscription mechanism in the same vein as WebSub, thanks to the modularity of specification conformance classes and the flexible nature of the notification contents, it is possible for applications to perform subscription-like interaction by taking on multiple roles.</p>\n\n                      <p>LDN requires that Senders and Consumers are equipped to discover Inboxes (receiving endpoints) through both HTTP headers and the body of an RDF resource. This slightly increased complexity around Inbox discovery for Senders and Consumers is a worthwhile tradeoff to lower the bar for publishers of target resources; Inboxes can be advertised from <em>any</em> document on the Web (through HTTP headers), and attached to even non-informational resources (through RDF statements). This increases the potential use cases for LDN.</p>\n\n                      <p>It is difficult to objectively measure performance metrics of different mechanisms as the various implementations use different servers and programming languages whose efficiency do not necessarily have any bearing on the protocols themselves. Mechanisms which require large payloads may increase the time for HTTP requests to be processed, and mechanisms that require verification add an additional network request to complete the process.</p>\n                    "^^rdf:HTML;

All articles, annotations, and notifications can be assembled in various combinations since they are ultimately expressed using the RDF language, which acts as a layer to describe them at any level of abstraction. All units of information in articles, annotations, and notifications are self-contained, context neutral, globally identifiable and accessible without additional processing. Resources can be versioned, marked as immutable, and archived, thereby treating them as stateless entities on the Web. Another way to reuse the resources is by dynamically embedding them in articles while communicating the original context eg. link to the source, parameters in which an annotation was created. Notifications can serve to establish <span id='bi-directional-linking'>bi-directional linking</span> eg. in citations.

                    <dd>Linked Data Notifications is a communication protocol that describes how applications can perform the roles of <em>senders</em>, <em>receivers</em>, and <em>consumers</em> when exchanging notifications. Such decoupling of application roles in context of a client\u2013server model permits interoperability between two classes of interactions, senders and receivers, or between consumers and receivers. These are atomic interactions in that they facilitate the design of loosely coupled systems that can exchange structured notifications as Linked Data. As such, the LDN protocol affords a high <cite><a href='#degree-of-control-in-ldn'>degree of control</a></cite> to actors in that they can use their preferred applications, store notifications where they prefer, switch between applications without relocating the notifications, and relocate the notifications without having to change applications. LDN\u2019s underlying mechanism triggers <em>registration</em>, fulfills <em>awareness</em>, and can support fulfilling the <em>certification</em> and <em>archiving</em> <cite><a href='#ldn-forces-functions'>functions in scientific communication</a></cite> in a decentralised ecosystem.</dd>

                    <dt id='technical-research-problems-artifacts-review'>How can Web technologies be employed to fulfill the core functions of scholarly communication in an open and interoperable way?</dt>
                    <dd>A decentralised client application based on the <cite>Open Web Platform</cite> can be devised to allow independent actors to exchange units of communication with decentralised storage services. <cite>dokieli</cite> demonstrates how an assembly of Web standards can come together in a cohesive way in order to enable actors to reach a high <cite><a href='#degree-of-control-in-dokieli'>degree of control</a></cite> over their creations and social activities. HTTP is used to perform CRUD operations, (HTTP) URIs to identify Web resources, and Linked Data design principles to uniformly represent, link, and discover information. Actors can identify themselves through WebID (HTTP URI) whether tied to a real or fictitious entity, extend their profile descriptions, and authenticate against servers with mechanisms like WebID-TLS and WebID-OIDC. Machine-interpretable profile descriptions also enables the client application to adapt to accommodate actor\u2019s capabilities. It is feasible to create and consume human- <em>and</em> machine-readable units of (scholarly) communication using standards such as RDFa in HTML, and be combined with other RDF serialisations based on technical specifications. A variety of Linked Data vocabularies can be used for semantic content authoring. The Linked Data Notifications protocol is used to exchange structured notifications. The Web Annotation Data Model and Protocol is used to associate resources and exchange annotations. The ActivityPub protocol is used to exchange social activities. The resources that dokieli generates are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable by other standards-compliant Linked Data applications. The resulting technical design operates under the notion of a scholarly ecosystem where applications are decoupled to fulfill the registration, awareness, certification, and archiving <cite><a href='#dokieli-forces-functions'>functions in scholarly communication</a></cite>.</dd>

                  <p>In summary, Linked Data Notifications is a building block for diverse decentralised and loosely coupled Web applications to exchange notifications, and fulfills the <em>awareness</em> function in scholarly communication. dokieli demonstrates how <abbr title='Registration, Awareness, Certification, Archiving'>RACA</abbr>-aware Linked Data applications can be designed while fulfilling essential <cite><a href='#decentralised-web-publishing'>decentralised Web publishing</a></cite> requirements.</p>

                <h3 property='schema:name'>Interpretations</h3>
                <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                  <p>In this section I reflect on what the findings of this thesis can mean to us and why we should care.</p>

                  <p id='paygo-linked-data'><strong>PAYGO Linked Data</strong>: Publishing units of communication by following the Linked Data principles is similar to the <cite><a href='#paygo'>pay as you go</a></cite> approach in dataspace systems in that knowledge on the Web can be extended incrementally without having everything up front or even a commitment to do so. This is particularly evident when disparate collection of units (or graphs) published by different entities can be connected when they share globally identifiable entities, as well as being universally useful when the content they identify is accessible.</p>

                  <p id='fair-linked-data'><strong>FAIR Linked Data</strong>: For openly accessible resources, I note that the <cite><a href='#linked-data'>Linked Data</a></cite> approach and technology stack can fulfill the <cite><a href='#fair-guiding-principles'>FAIR guiding principles</a></cite>. One generalisation that could be made from this is that Linked Data design principles can be adopted as a base requirement when building interoperable Web applications, which would also fulfill FAIR. After all, the FAIR principles does not prescribe the mechanisms for Web data, and as such, interoperability across applications for independently produced FAIR-conformance is not systematically guaranteed. In contrast, the Linked Data approach specifies the mechanisms within the framework of the <cite><a href='#architecture-of-the-web'>Architecture of the Web</a></cite> and guarantees interop.</p>

                  <p id='decentralised-identity-and-authentication'><strong>Decentralised Identity and Authentication</strong>: Applications primarily operate in a read-only information space in the absence of decentralised identities and authentication mechanisms. Client applications can be loosely coupled with servers when the source of authentication is distributed. Actors can use independently built client applications to perform CRUD operations provided that they can authenticate using their preferred WebID, as well as have the possibility to decide on the storage location of their data. Thus, it is possible to distribute scholarly contributions on the Web based on an actor (or contributor) centric model.</p>

                  <p id='interoperable-applications'><strong>Interoperable Applications</strong>: Decoupling of the forces and functions in scholarly communication in context of the Web necessitates interoperable applications through the use of standard data formats and communication protocols. These class of applications need to only reflect user\u2019s intent within the frame of a loosely coupled system design. That is, applications having semantic understanding of the affordances of the system makes it possible to automate information exchange. Consequently enabling users to switch between standards-compliant applications without interfering with existing data. For instance, HTTP, URI, and HTML are widely used standards on the Web enabling us to use any user agent (like a Web browser) on the Open Web Platform. Similarly, one layer up on the interoperability ladder would be to employ communication protocols and data formats that are capable of addressing specific use cases.</p>

                  <p id='sociotechnical-centralisation'><strong>Sociotechnical Centralisation</strong>: We can observe different forms of centralisation within decentralisation. As we adopt mechanisms with the intention of decentralisation and interoperability, are we free of all forms of centralisation and vendor lock-ins? For instance, <cite><a href='#uri-ownership'>URI Ownership</a></cite> discussed the inherent social centralisation of DNS in that individuals merely rent domain names from registrars and maintain the mapping to physical servers. <cite><a href='#semantic-organisation-of-notifications'>Semantic Organisation of Notifications</a></cite> highlights one form of organic centralisation around the choice of Linked Data vocabularies that the applications make use of. Technical Web specifications for the most part reflect the group\u2019s goals, cultural norms or biases. For instance, LDN was initially incubated in the <cite><a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://solid.mit.edu/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190628115812/https://solid.mit.edu/' data-versiondate='2019-06-28T11:58:12Z'>Solid project</a></cite> within the understanding of a socially-aware read-write Linked Data paradigm, and then developed to be a technical specification through the W3C <abbr title='Social Web Working Group'>SWWG</abbr> as part of a broader context of decentralisation efforts.</p>

                  <p id='aaa-raca'><strong>AAA in RACA</strong>: <cite><a href='#function-of-peer-review'>Function of Peer Review</a></cite> noted the intentions and limits of peer review in context of the Web. It is neither the case that the right, the privilege, or the practice of the notion <q><a href='#aaa'>anyone being (technically) allowed to say anything about anything</a></q> is exempt from ethical considerations. As we have seen in modern Web social media, management and distribution of misinformation and disinformation is profitable and poses a danger to civilisation. For instance, as electronic publication has also been blurring the lines between academic work and personal opinions, making the distinction between the two as part of the scientific endeavour has only become more vital. In that respect, the notion of <cite><a href='#self-publishing'>self-publishing</a></cite> does not entail quality-controlled and certified units of communication in and itself, but rather focuses on increasing actors\u2019 immediate role and control. Thus, trust and accountability remain as social processes.</p>

                  <p id='school-of-thought'><strong>School of Thought</strong>: Some of dokieli\u2019s design decisions were driven by the need to enable actors to autonomously participate in a decentralised scholarly ecosystem. With respect to the four functions in scientific communication, the expectations are to operate under a <em>deconstructed</em> or <em>decoupled</em> model while providing high <cite><a href='#degree-of-control'>Degree of Control</a></cite> to content creators and consumers, as well as generating and reusing interoperable data. This approach shares some conceptual similarities to the <q cite='http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ginsparg/physics/blurb/pg01unesco.html'>self-archiving</q> approach in that scholars have the right to freely share their Web resources from open repositories. However, a distinction between the <q>self-archiving</q> initiative and <cite><a href='#self-publishing'>self-publishing</a></cite> in context of the <cite><a href='#linked-research'>Linked Research</a></cite> goal can be made in that while an actor may prefer to share their contributions through third-party controlled components, the baseline for <q>self-publishing</q> is that they are not required to. Thus, the network location and the applications that are used to make the content available are orthogonal to the notion of what constitutes a scholarly contribution. Lastly, parallel characteristics between dokieli\u2019s approach and the <cite><a href='#republic-of-letters'>Republic of Letters</a></cite> can be made in that both operate under the idea of scholarly activities to be a researcher-centric model \u2013 direct information exchange between authors and readers \u2013 without requiring intermediaries.</p>

                  <p id='sociotechnical-advancement'><strong>Sociotechnical Advancement</strong>: Given our half a millennia of experience in mass print publishing, and half a century on electronic publishing, we are in a position to situate, examine and question our assumptions as to what constitutes scholarly knowledge exchange and participation in context of the Web. If research communication is predominately and increasingly driven by the Web, how can we approach the integration of scholarly processes with the inherent properties of the Web? One way to look at this is by <cite><a href='#the-printing-press-as-an-agent-of-change'>examining history</a></cite>: the printing press played a major role in moving the non-literate public to learn to read and write for themselves. Given the Web, we find ourselves in a similar situation with different modes of communication. For instance, the Web \u2013 an environment for simultaneous read and write operations on hypermedia \u2013 inherently enables anyone to be a publisher, where each actor can exercise their full creativity and ability to express the shape of their content. In order to use the Web effectively \u2013 as far as taking advantage of its built-in characteristics, the research community needs to better position itself to self-publish and disseminate their knowledge, as well as be more attributable and accountable in their social engagement. This kind of ongoing evolution is necessary for the advancement of research communication and consequently the society. Moving towards Web-centric information flow requires the scholarly ecosystem to unchain itself from antiquated practices and inadequate use of the available medium. In context of major communication shifts, we have not scratched the surface \u2013 30 years into the advent of the Web is still a brief period in history.</p>

                  <p id='addressing-social-implications'><strong>Addressing Social Implications</strong>: <cite><a href='#social-implications'>Social Implications of LDN</a></cite> looked at a particular area of design considerations for notifications. <cite><a href='#activities'>dokieli\u2019s Activities</a></cite> describes how a "friend of a friend" social network can work. An AAA-based ecosystem while can potentially enable everyone to voice themselves, the Web is not immune to the distribution of propaganda, cyberbullying or hate speech. How can we cultivate positive behaviour, and design systems to discover and filter content based on ethical norms or personal preferences? Thus, in context of <cite><a href='#decentralised-web-publishing'>decentralised Web publishing</a></cite>, future research can investigate:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>How can harassment and abuse be prevented or handled?</li>
                    <li>How would moderation or civil discourse work?</li>
                    <li>How can a resource prohibit or consent to be annotated at fine granularity?</li>
                    <li>How can the conditions to annotate and notify be indicated and monitored?</li>
                    <li>How can a resource\u2019s annotation policy and rules be respected?</li>
                    <li>What may be the conditions to associate different identities?</li>
                    <li>How can domain expertise be factored in?</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>The W3C TAG Finding, <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212314/https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:14Z'>Ethical Web Principles</a></cite>, 2019, sets out ethical principles which will guide the Technical Architecture Group. These principles can be applied when designing systems in order to provide a net positive social benefit.</p>

                  <p id='extended-profiles'><strong>Extended Profiles</strong>: WebID Profile descriptions can be extended to enable richer decentralised clientside applications in that both the user interface and the content can be a reflection of actor\u2019s preferences and abilities. What kinds of "preference negotiation" can be made?</p>

                  <p id='privacy-aware-information-space'><strong>Privacy Aware Information Spaces</strong>: Actors can be better supported in their decision-making if their applications are privacy-aware and respecting, for example through the use of standards like <abbr title='Open Digital Rights Language'>ODRL</abbr>. This leads to the possibility of observing the interplay of forces and functions in scholarly communication, and in particular, how privacy-aware applications can generate and consume new forms of content and interactions. How can a decentralised ecosystem balance privacy, integrity and availability?</p>

                  <p id='lossless-citations'><strong>Lossless Citations</strong>: Applications supporting semantic content authoring enables fine-grained connections to be created between units of communication. Approaches like in <cite><a href='#contextual-citations'>contextual citations</a></cite> (with semantically typed relations) make it possible to preserve authors\u2019 intended connection between units of communication. Further study on creating, annotating, as well as extracting citation Linked Data can provide further insights into (scholarly) content. How can open research questions be systematically discovered by machines?</p>

                  <p typeof='skos:Concept' resource='#raca-aware-applications' rel='schema:hasPart' id='raca-aware-applications'><strong property='skos:prefLabel'>RACA-Aware Applications</strong>: <span property='skos:definition'><cite><a href='#forces-and-functions-in-specifications' rel='cito:extends'>Forces and Functions in Specifications</a></cite> characterised open Web protocols, standards, and models in context of scholarly communication. While this contribution is not intended to be a complete collection of approaches, future work can extend the current <cite><a href='#characteristics-of-specifications'>RDF Data Cube dataset</a></cite> and the EARL results including additional subjects with new observations. The availability of such structured dataset can help answering the knowledge questions of future research when designing "<dfn property='skos:altLabel'>RACA-Aware</dfn>" decentralised and interoperable applications. Thus, potentially answering a research question along the lines of <em>How can we systematically remix open Web specifications in order to design RACA-Aware applications?</em> Another area of research would be for applications to systematically and adaptively determine, as well as apply the right abstraction level for content based on actor\u2019s needs.</span></p>

                  <p id='on-demand-archiving'><strong>On-Demand Archiving</strong>: While there are publicly usable on-demand archiving services eg. Internet Archive, there is a need for client applications to be able to both choose from existing archiving services as well as allow users to specify their preferred services when making <em>contextual citations</em> or archiving any unit of communication. To that end, future research can investigate how personal or community-controlled archiving services can be designed in order to enable decentralised client applications.</p>

                  <p id='linked-data-aware-user-agents'><strong>Linked Data-Aware User Agents</strong>: At the moment, common user agents like the Web browser are not natively equipped to parse and re-serialise data expressed with the RDF language, or have the ability to construct SPARQL queries and process query results, yet alone adapt the user interface based on content. Consequently, client applications and Web Extensions are forced to include (JavaScript) code libraries to handle these features until there is built-in support. Such method of inclusions increases the complexity of using as well as maintaining the libraries. Future research can investigate effective ways to natively integrate RDF and SPARQL libraries and support corresponding APIs in the Web browser so that client applications can focus on higher-level user intentions as opposed to lower-level data management.</p>

                  <p id='third-party-control-considered-harmful'><strong>Third-Party Control Considered Harmful</strong>: The current state of scholarly communication on the Web is ravelled with sociotechnical limits and complications. The overarching technical research problem aimed to investigate and design Web-centric artifacts that would enable content creators and consumers to have more control over their activities, as well as to effectively exchange information while respecting actors\u2019 privacy. The Web continues to enable anyone to be a publisher. The findings of thesis reveals that third-party publishers are not required and that <cite><a href='#decentralised-web-publishing'>decentralised Web publishing</a></cite> is, and ultimately continues to be, feasible <em>for everyone</em>.</p>

              <p id='to-boldly-go-where-we-have-not-gone-before'><strong>To boldly go where we have not gone before</strong>: I contend that one way to advance research communication on the Web in its totality is that, social policies, funding, research exchange, as well as professional incentives, all need to accurately reflect the affordances of the media. The Linked Research initiative ironically indicates the need for a <em>counter-environment</em> as a means of practising the dominant and unnoticed environment, that is the Web as a socially-aware communication medium. The social conventions that surrounds the notion of a "scholarly contribution" can be anticipated to be revisited in order to improve the accessibility of knowledge, and be more inclusive and equitable for everyone. The evolution of sociotechnical systems require people\u2019s adaptability at the same time. In order for the scholarly ecosystem to be genuinely \u201copen\u201d and inclusive, systems need to be ethically grounded and interoperate with the notion of <q>universal design</q> \u2013 actor diversity with variations in needs, capabilities, and aspirations.</p>

These kind of systems allow users to authenticate with their identity provider from preconfigured authorities, as well providing their own accounts on the system. Each service generally has a custom API and vocabulary that a trusted client application (normally hosted on the same server) uses to interact with the server in order to perform <abbr title='Create, Read, Update, and Delete'>CRUD</abbr> operations through the user interface. They are categorically a client-server that is <cite><a href='#client-server-spectrum'>tightly coupled</a></cite> on identity, identification, authentication, authorization, and storage.</p>

Annotations may be private, public, or for a group, and can be threaded to form conversations around a piece of content. Each instance of a client application is preconfigured to use its own API endpoint against a particular server to perform CRUD operations, such as creating and finding annotations and related data. Actors use the client application to control the user accounts at a server or preconfigured identity providers eg. hypothes.is, orcid.org, acknowledged by a server. Annotations can be self-hosted, however different servers do not federate. The HTML representations of annotations requires JavaScript to be available and enabled on the user-agent in order to look up and fetch the annotation\u2019s contents in JSON from its API and update the <abbr title='Document Object Model'>DOM</abbr>. The annotation URLs, proxy, and the browser extension uses the <cite>Google Analytics</cite> tracking service per active URL. On active URLs, the client application by default makes API calls to the Hypothes.is server to check for annotations. On-demand archiving services like the Internet Archive are currently unable to properly archive an annotation\u2019s contents. It is possible to fetch an annotation that is represented with the WA Data Model from a server, however the annotation is not machine-discoverable ie. other applications will need to be uniquely configured with Hypothes.is\u2019s annotation URL template in order to acquire a JSON-LD representation - which is semantically a subset of the information provided in the HTML and JSON representations.</p>

                      <p>One common architectural aspect to these systems is that while they have some characteristics of a loosely coupled system, the server is expected to work with a designated client application. For instance, they require account creation and data storage with respect to an appointed centralised service. In essence, the user interface is restricted to communicate with a particular service endpoint, as well as an authority that governs all actor identities and the data they have produced. They allow multiple participants to annotate and hold discussions around the primary content; users must access their accounts to be notified of updates to conversations, and data from both the main content and related discussion is confined to the service which was used to create it. The data formats and schemas are consistent across storage instances in that it is possible to migrate data from one location to another using the same server application, storage mechanism and data schema. Archivability of Web resources varies and their access being at the discretion of server owners.</p>

The client application was integrated into Amaya where it was able to store and recall annotations locally or from a remote annotation server, with the expectation of an access controlled server using the standard HTTP authentication mechanisms. Annotea annotations are independent Web resources. Annotea has a <cite><a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/User/Protocol.html' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212307/https://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/User/Protocol.html' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:07Z'>protocol</a></cite> that specifies the CRUD operations for servers and clients, and enables different applications to be built. Annotea in Amaya for instance allowed the user to specify the URI of an annotation server. In order to reference target resources, annotations used <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-element/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212307/https://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-element/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:07Z'>XML Pointer Language</a></cite> (<abbr title='XML Pointer Language'>XPointer</abbr>) to specify the part of HTML or XML-based documents that the annotation was in context of. Annotea laid out a path for subsequent systems, influencing <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212308/http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:08Z'>Open Annotation Data Model</a></cite> which later evolved into the WA Data Model.</p>

                      <p>Amaya and Annotea emerged at a time when publishing and consumption standards on the Open Web Platform were still relatively in the early phases. The most apparent conceptual similarities between the Amaya and Annotea combination with dokieli is that they treat the hosting document as one of the environments to perform read and write operations from.</p>

                      <hr></hr>

                      <p id='dokieli-hypothes.is'>A tentative view of the interoperability between Hypothes.is and dokieli is as follows. The client applications Hypothes.is and dokieli are non-conflicting in that when used in the same content or context, each can still be used on its own. A Hypothes.is client application can search and fetch annotations from an associated server using the Hypothes.is API, and render them on the target resource. dokieli can discover the WA annotation service of a Web resource, fetch annotations from servers conforming to WAP and LDP specifications, and render them on the target resource. Additional data about the annotation can be created and reused in both applications. A Hypothes.is client application can authenticate with a particular server using OAuth. Actors with WebID in dokieli can authenticate with servers supporting WebID-TLS and WebID-OIDC. Both can create annotations given authorization. Hypothes.is application can extend and direct annotations to a community group using the same server. dokieli triggers content negotiation with servers to determine preferred RDF serialization of Web Annotation and profile. The Hypothes.is client can only fetch annotations from a corresponding Hypothes.is server. dokieli can only fetch annotations from servers implementing LDP, WAP or AP. Putting the method of fetching an annotation resource aside, it is possible for either client application to render an annotation serialized as JSON-LD that is created by the other application. The notion of "private" content in Hypothes.is is tied to the annotation server that client application is associated with, whereas "private" content in dokieli is associated to actor\u2019s preferred storage location and access control policies based on individual, class of, or group WebIDs.</p>

                      <p>Existing server and client applications in particular to authoring and publishing are complex systems in that while they adhere or adopt some aspects of open Web specifications, they also include proprietary designs. Such systems also have varying characteristics of centralisation and decentralisation, hence, while some aspects are interoperable, other areas require post facto efforts to interop.</p>

                      <p>The tools which provide good collaborative editing user-interfaces appear to do so at the expense of data ownership and interoperability; those which promote creation and publication of data in open reusable formats are lacking facilities for linking discourse and conversation to concepts published. Decentralised creations also mean that each author can choose their own semantics eg. their own vocabulary to annotate using the RDF language, and then such decentralised documents can link to each other and their schemas can also be mapped to each other, whereas in centralised systems this is (if they support structured semantics at all) often prescribed, either technically enforced, or encouraged by social convention.</p>

                      <p>Future work can examine how additional features can be realised on top of existing Web standards, or where more development is required. Real-time collaborative editing is often realised with centralised communication (even though some peer to peer alternatives exist). Services like top-down annotations or automated entity marking can improve the discoverability of a publication, yet the question of how to offer these without being tied to certain servers as well as Web identities served from fixed servers needs further work.</p>

                      <p>dokieli shows that it is possible for people to interact with each other without central coordination. Users can choose storage space for their content independently of the applications with which they edit and view that content. Documents are connected statically through links and dynamically through Linked Data Notifications. This is a proof for the viability of a social and decentralised authoring and annotation environment based on Web standards. dokieli happens to be one application that demonstrates the potentials of decentralised notifications and annotations. The information it creates does not result in a vendor lock-in, as other applications are able to reuse them \u2013 given agreement on using open Web standards.</p>

                      <p>On the other hand, dokieli\u2019s use of standards shows that dokieli itself is only one means to an end: once the document has been created, it lives on independently. The <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_machine' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105639/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_machine' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:39Z'>social machine</a></cite> consists of people and documents, connected by Web standards, with dokieli acting as just one possible catalyst. Different Web applications can incorporate any of dokieli\u2019s functions and implement the principles to varying extent. Since the data is decoupled from the application, we avoid the <em>walled garden</em> problem of current social platforms today, as well as various forms of vendor lock-in with some applications, even if they are are operating in a loosely coupled environment. In essence, it is possible to swap dokieli with another client application and still communicate with any standards-compliant server. This is one of the key steps to liberating actors to create and share without setting burdens on URI, data and application control.</p>

                      <p>A couple of important sociotechnical challenges remain, and implications on autonomy. Resources might want to indicate in a granular way which actions they support or encourage, such as assessments, bookmarking, or sharing, and perhaps conditions about which notifications should be sent when any of these events take place. In order to encourage positive behaviour, we might want ways to provide moderation, and solutions to prevent harassment and abuse. Closely related is the issue of identity, pseudonymity and anonymity, and its relation with trust and verification. There are also social implications of dokieli\u2019s Web browser extension and social graph. For instance, the ability of annotating and sharing information even if the primary article does not have an inbox or an annotation service. There is no administrator that oversees everything, but that each actor has control privileges to what they are given. Having the ability to annotate anything and stored at a preferred location enables actor autonomy. This can be contrasted with annotation systems that may restrict annotations from getting created with particular targets or annotations having particular information in its body.</p>

        "\n                  <p>I have discussed how notifications may be purposed in a number of ways in a decentralised scholarly communication ecosystem. In addition, outlined specific use cases, and used these to derive design considerations. An overview of existing protocols for decentralised notifications indicates their respective strengths and shortcomings, and a new protocol is designed to meet our needs in light of this. The Linked Data Notifications protocol separates the concepts of <em>senders</em>, <em>receivers</em> and <em>consumers</em> of notifications for modularity and leverages Linked Data concepts of shared vocabularies and URIs, thus providing a building block for notifications between diverse decentralised and loosely coupled Web applications. The three roles can be implemented independently from each other or all together in one system. This permits end users more freedom to switch between the online tools they use, as well as generating greater value when notifications from different sources can be shared between applications and used in combination.</p>\n\n                  <p>The utility and flexibility of LDN is demonstrated to some extent by the various implementations reported as part of the standardisation process. In this final concluding section, I evaluate LDN by comparing it along various axes with the potential alternatives. I also explain its relationship with other Web standards in the Linked Data or decentralisation space, and describe how LDN addresses users\u2019 degree of control over their data and applications. Finally, I discuss additional considerations that were omitted from LDN at the time of standardisation but may be important to take into account for certain implementations.</p>\n\n                  <section resource='#comparison-of-notification-mechanisms' rel='schema:hasPart' inlist='' id='comparison-of-notification-mechanisms'>\n                    <h4 property='schema:name'>Comparison of Notification Mechanisms</h4>\n                    <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>\n\n                      <p>This section covers a direct comparison between existing notification mechanisms from the <cite><a href='#overview-of-web-notification-systems'>Overview of Web Notification Systems</a></cite> with Linked Data Notifications, followed by a discussion of the trade-offs that were necessary to realize certain benefits of LDN.

LDN is the only mechanism which describes the Consumer (C) role; this explicitly highlights how notifications can be useful to applications other than those concerned with sending and receiving. For mechanisms which include a Subscriber (U) role, the Receiver (R) is essentially also the Consumer, so Receivers are less generic and require specialised payloads. In this respect, LDN is a more modular specification. LDN Receivers need not be concerned with additional actions beyond storing and exposing notifications; complex and domain-specific uses of the notifications are left to Consumers, resulting in a lot more flexibility in terms of lightweight end-user applications.</p>\n\n                      <p>WebSub differs in terms of the number of roles, but not the actual functions of the specified roles. The hub is an intermediate party which plays the role of a Receiver and a Sender, relaying notifications from the original Sender (or publisher) to the Subscriber (or ultimate Receiver), but nonetheless only makes notifications available to the Subscriber and no other applications.</p>\n\n                      <p>LDN enforces that notifications should be reusable, and specifies how Receivers should make notifications available for Consumers. The other mechanisms either consider notification reuse as inapplicable or leave it optional and unspecified.</p>\n\n                      <p>This is also tied to to persistence and retrievability in that LDN requires notifications to be identified by dereferenceable HTTP URIs. The other notification mechanisms treat notifications as ephemeral resources which only exist until they are delivered to a Receiver.</p>\n\n                      <p>The mechanisms with the <em>fat ping</em> approach require structured data in XML or JSON-LD. Only LDN requires the use of RDF through JSON-LD, and optional content negotiation for other RDF syntaxes. Thus, notification payloads can include references to other retrievable resources, or can embed all relevant data directly in the payload.</p>\n\n                      <p>Approaches which send only URLs (as with linkback) rely on the receiver interpreting a third-party resource, which may or may not contain structured content or be under the control of the sender. Approaches which offer additional guidance to aid the receiver in interpreting the source document(s) nonetheless still restrict the sender. LDN therefore offers flexibility to senders, increasing the potential uses for the notification mechanism. LDN compensates for increased complexity on the receiver\u2019s end by recommending filtering mechanisms, and moving most of the burden of understanding notification contents to the consumer role. In placing no constraints on the notification payload, LDN enables a sender to be precise and lossless with the data it is transmitting. As such LDN can cover a broader variety of use cases.</p>\n\n                      <p>LDN recommends that Receiver applications perform some processing of the payload. This is to enable users to configure their Receivers to filter out spam or customise them for particular domains, but is not required; such filtering could also be left to or supplemented by Consumers. In contrast, Semantic Pingback and Webmention require receivers to parse the form-encoded payload and then to perform fetching of the URLs within and additional parsing of the documents those URLs identify. This is required in order to verify the message (by finding the target URL). Such processing in LDN is left at the discretion of the Receiver; linkback style verification is not required, but also not forbidden. </p>\n\n                      <p>As WebSub requires subscribing as part of its core design, hubs are expected to perform specific actions on receipt of a <em>subscription</em> request (where the payload is tightly constrained), but not necessarily to process the contents of a notification sent by a <em>publisher</em> (where the payload can be anything; how they handle this depends on the content-type). </p>\n\n                      <p>Though LDN does not specify a subscription mechanism in the same vein as WebSub, thanks to the modularity of specification conformance classes and the flexible nature of the notification contents, it is possible for applications to perform subscription-like interaction by taking on multiple roles.</p>\n\n                      <p>LDN requires that Senders and Consumers are equipped to discover Inboxes (receiving endpoints) through both HTTP headers and the body of an RDF resource. This slightly increased complexity around Inbox discovery for Senders and Consumers is a worthwhile tradeoff to lower the bar for publishers of target resources; Inboxes can be advertised from <em>any</em> document on the Web (through HTTP headers), and attached to even non-informational resources (through RDF statements). This increases the potential use cases for LDN.</p>\n\n                      <p>It is difficult to objectively measure performance metrics of different mechanisms as the various implementations use different servers and programming languages whose efficiency do not necessarily have any bearing on the protocols themselves. Mechanisms which require large payloads may increase the time for HTTP requests to be processed, and mechanisms that require verification add an additional network request to complete the process.</p>\n                    </div>\n                  </section>\n\n                  <section resource='#interoperability-across-specifications' rel='schema:hasPart' inlist='' id='interoperability-across-specifications'>\n                    <h4 property='schema:name'>Interoperability Across Specifications</h4>\n                    <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>\n                      <p>There are several technical specifications that LDN may be interoperably combined.

There are further considerations which may be of interest to implementers, or may constitute future work around extending the core protocol, which are worth outlining here.</p>\n\n                      <p id='subscribing-to-notifications'><strong>Subscribing to Notifications</strong>: The interaction between consumers and receivers describes a <em>pull</em> mechanism. A <cite><a href='#subscribing'>subscribing</a></cite> mechanism in which consumers <em>request</em> that receivers <em>push</em> content changes to them is left out of scope. Much of the related work <em>requires</em> notifications to be explicitly solicited to trigger sending. Since in a decentralised model, receivers may not be aware of possible sources for notifications, our sender-receiver relationship depends on the sender\u2019s autonomy to make such decisions by itself. This does not preclude the scenario in which a receiver may wish to solicit notifications from a particular sender, but as there are already <em>subscription</em> mechanisms in wide use on the Web eg. ActivityPub, WebSub, <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212256/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:56Z'>The WebSocket Protocol</a></cite> (<abbr title='The WebSocket Protocol'>RFC 6455</abbr>), <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8030' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212256/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8030' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:56Z'>Generic Event Delivery Using HTTP Push</a></cite> (<abbr title='Generic Event Delivery Using HTTP Push'>RFC 8030</abbr>), and can be interoperably combined with LDN, we do not need to specify it as part of our protocol. A push based interaction can still be arranged between LDN applications, where it would be implementation specific. For example, in a notification, a sender specifies the location of an inbox where it can receive updates about content changes. Then, an application that consumes the notifications manages its own subscriber list, and takes the role of sender in order to push content to the inbox as specified in the notification. Another specification-level integration of LDN pertaining to subscribing is that ActivityPub\u2019s <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#follow-activity-inbox' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212236/https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:36Z'>Follow Activity</a></cite> is a notification requesting to be notified of target\u2019s activities when they are created.

The server then dispatches notifications to the inboxes of these actors.</p>\n\n                      <p id='semantic-organisation-of-notifications'><strong>Semantic Organisation of Notifications</strong>: While LDN facilitates a decentralised architecture for notification exchange, it does not prescribe the structure and semantics of the notifications themselves. The composition of the notifications are unspecified to foster different kinds of applications to be built to communicate information in any domain. Consequently, organisation of notification models materialises through the fact that domain-centric applications create and consume what is meaningful to them in order to coordinate among themselves. So while the notification system is globally decentralised, it enables communication that can be specialised and be only useful and meaningful to applications that understands a particular message\u2019s semantics.</p>\n\n                      <p id='inbox-paging'><strong>Inbox Paging</strong>: We need to consider both the needs of software systems and humans when large amounts of notification data are being generated and shared between diverse applications which may be operating without knowledge of each other. To organise and manage large amount of notifications over time, mechanisms should be in place to break representations of collections of notifications into multiple paged responses that may be easier to consume by applications.</p>\n\n                      <p id='updating-and-deleting-notifications'><strong>Updating and Deleting Notifications</strong>: Receivers may want to carry out resource management or garbage collection, or permit consumers or other applications to do so. For example, an application to consume messages might let an authenticated and authorised user \u2018mark as read\u2019 by adding a triple to the inbox or notification contents.</p>\n\n                      <p id='social-implications'><strong>Social Implications</strong>: In an ecosystem where anyone can (technically) say anything about anything, we can acknowledge the social challenges surrounding that in context of notifications. As the LDN protocol facilitates distribution and discovery of information, it can amplify misinformation and (community-centric) inappropriate content, as well as online and offline social dangers effectively. That is, consumers of notifications can be exposed to such information if an inbox is not managed properly. LDN may offer one way to mitigate this problem in that, the actors that control an inbox can decide on which notifications can persist and which to be removed, thereby one way to eliminate references to undesirable content created by other parties. At the same time, the same privilege can also be used to filter information and have bias towards certain parties. This is a form of decentralised curation in that while no single inbox can oversee the discovery of a resource (as there are alternative ways), it enables the owners of receivers to exert their authority on the notifications that makes it into their system. It is a middle-ground in that, on one hand, individuals can voice themselves by registering and making their resources accessible, owners of inboxes can choose not to provide pointers to it. I will further revisit some of these concerns in <cite><a href='#addressing-social-implications'>Addressing Social Implications</a></cite>.</p>\n                    </div>\n                  </section>\n\n                  <p>As we have seen in <cite>Scholarly Communication on the Web</cite>, research communication is continuously transitioning from print-centric to Web-centric. LDN being rooted to Web-centric protocols and formats builds on a reliable and relevant foundation for it to be used as part of the future scholarly communications ecosystem.</p>\n\n                  <p>There are many diverse use cases for notifications within scholarly communication now and likely to be more in the future, so designing the protocol to be flexible permits a common thread of data sharing between these different cases, as well as accommodating unexpected use. Specialisation may be necessary for notifications to be particularly useful in a lot of scenarios, however the protocol is not the level to do this. Thus, LDN leaves it up to applications to specialise their functionality for particular domains or user needs by using semantically <cite><a href='#self-describing'>self-descriptive</a></cite> notifications.</p>\n\n                  <p>In the next section, I present LDN as one part of the broader scholarly communication ecosystem through an implementation which ties together many relevant protocols, and encompasses article authoring, annotations, and social interactions.</p>\n                "^^rdf:HTML;

                  <p>There is an abundance of scientific information on the Web. However, humans and machines have restricted access, are required to pay, or hindered to efficiently discover relations.

LR serves as a conceptual framework that describes how actors can control their interactions and data, make use of human- and machine-readable information through Web-interfaces, as well as how decentralised and socially-aware applications can exchange information on route to fulfilling the core functions of scholarly communication.</p>

                  <p id='traps'><strong>Traps</strong>: Are there ideological and technology traps in LR? The traps can be seen as analogous to McLuhan\u2019s <cite><a href='#effect-reverses-into'>Reverses Into</a></cite> effect. When the LR design principles are "pushed to the extreme", highly specialised and fine-grained centralised systems may emerge while still operating within the larger decentralised system on the Web. The degree of interoperability among the autonomous systems will vary. The artifacts may be controlled or managed by a new generation of entities in information spaces, eg. agents delegated to perform certain operations on behalf of an actor. Just as centralised publishing and distribution services currently exist for the dominating print-centric industry, the medium can still accommodate similar control over semantic and granular scientific resources. Individual autonomy without cooperation among the actors can make it difficult to establish and maintain trust.</p>

                  <p id='reconfiguring-forces-and-functions'><strong>Reconfiguring Forces and Functions</strong>: The existing or prior models for information exchange that has been described so far primarily focus on institutional or subject repository driven scholarly communication. They inherently require the involvement of third-party service providers \u2013 for- or non-profit \u2013 which impose a particular arrangement of the coupling of the scholarly information space per <em>forces and functions</em>. For instance, traditional journals most commonly couple the registration and certification functions, whereas the configuration based on LR allows different actors to activate different functions on demand.</p>

                  <p id='basic-costs'><strong>Basic Costs</strong>: From the perspective of an actor, the costs for a personal domain name along with data storage can be in the range of 100 USD per year with sufficient space for common Web publishing \u2013 "unlimited" amount of registration of units of communication and publishing any hypermedia. As for archiving services, it would be typically handled by "external" stakeholders with respect to the actor sharing their registered content.</p>

                  <p id='social-barriers'><strong>Social Barriers</strong>: At this time, promotion and tenure are integral to the academic profession. The incentives in the academic profession predominantly relies on an ecosystem that is largely led by third-party publishers and services. LR can be seen as market driven from the perspective of self-driven actors in the system \u2013 similar to proponents of the preprint movement.</p>

As such the convenience that comes with centralisation is at the user\u2019s expense where ownership and access control is compromised, and ultimately the user\u2019s privacy and security. Moreover, from the service provider\u2019s perspective, there is no particular incentive to build interoperable systems as that would entail losing control over data. Since such services hinder information flow; information in one service is not necessarily usable by other applications and services and vice versa, they effectively form information silos \u2013 <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2008/Papers/MSNWS/index.html' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20180830094126/http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2008/Papers/MSNWS/index.html' data-versiondate='2018-08-30T09:41:26Z'>Decentralization: The Future of Online Social Networking</a></cite>, 2008.</p>\n\n                  <p>In addition to state controlled network infrastructures, information empires like <cite>Google</cite>, <cite>Facebook</cite>, <cite>Amazon</cite>, <cite>Elsevier</cite>, as well as a long tail of (social media) services, exert a great deal of influence on how information can be accessed, expressed and reused. This influence impacts society, affecting the cost of accessing information, the effort required to produce and distribute, long-standing privacy concerns (in exchange of some convenience for users), as well as how and the amount of information that is aggregated, shared and filtered.</p>\n\n                  <p id='trusting-centralised-services'>Independence from centralised services and platforms is a necessity for ownership of published ideas, and to establish authenticity and trust.

After all, there is a continued tension between unrestricted publication rights on the one hand, and a guarantee of balanced, verified information on the other. In a fully decentralised setting, each source is filterless and responsible for its own quality and reputation, while consumers are free to selectively (dis-)trust certain sources using any mechanism they desire, for example through trusted parties.

Hence, there is a need to <em>re-decentralise the Web</em> so that it benefits individuals, the public, as well as the scholarly communication market as a whole.

That is, machine-readable semantics are embedded directly into human-visible prose through RDFa. dokieli applies this technique to avoid data duplication in the same document \u2013 adhering to the <abbr title='Don\u2019t Repeat Yourself'>DRY</abbr> principle. The approach also helps to avoid the creation and usage of multiple data islands, ie. separately for humans and machines. Consequently, it has the advantage of not having any dependency on JavaScript in order to make the hidden machine-readable content be consumable from a human user interface. One exception to this rule is where dokieli allows authors to embed Turtle, JSON-LD, or TriG data blocks (useful for Nanopublications) in HTML typically for the purpose of including complementary non-prose structured information. We cannot know in advance what new kinds of information or data can be integrated into articles, so to facilitate extensibility, dokieli sets no constraints on what information can be embedded nor how it can be be expressed. Hence, information can be expressed using different vocabularies, enabling reuse of existing data models and the addition of new semantic expressions.</span></p>\n\n                          <p typeof='dio:DesignDecision' resource='#composability' rel='dio:leadsTo' id='composability'><strong property='schema:name'>Composability</strong>: <span property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>Resources generated by dokieli are composable on the data layer as there are semantic relations between units of information, both internally and externally identifiable units.

All units of information in articles, annotations, and notifications are self-contained, context neutral, globally identifiable and accessible without additional processing. Resources can be versioned, marked as immutable, and archived, thereby treating them as stateless entities on the Web. Another way to reuse the resources is by dynamically embedding them in articles while communicating the original context eg. link to the source, parameters in which an annotation was created.

That is, machine-readable semantics are embedded directly into human-visible prose through RDFa. dokieli applies this technique to avoid data duplication in the same document \u2013 adhering to the <abbr title='Don\u2019t Repeat Yourself'>DRY</abbr> principle. The approach also helps to avoid the creation and usage of multiple data islands, ie. separately for humans and machines. Consequently, it has the advantage of not having any dependency on JavaScript in order to make the hidden machine-readable content be consumable from a human user interface. One exception to this rule is where dokieli allows authors to embed Turtle, JSON-LD, or TriG data blocks (useful for Nanopublications) in HTML typically for the purpose of including complementary non-prose structured information. We cannot know in advance what new kinds of information or data can be integrated into articles, so to facilitate extensibility, dokieli sets no constraints on what information can be embedded nor how it can be be expressed. Hence, information can be expressed using different vocabularies, enabling reuse of existing data models and the addition of new semantic expressions.</span></p>\n\n                          <p typeof='dio:DesignDecision' resource='#composability' rel='dio:leadsTo' id='composability'><strong property='schema:name'>Composability</strong>: <span property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>Resources generated by dokieli are composable on the data layer as there are semantic relations between units of information, both internally and externally identifiable units.

All units of information in articles, annotations, and notifications are self-contained, context neutral, globally identifiable and accessible without additional processing. Resources can be versioned, marked as immutable, and archived, thereby treating them as stateless entities on the Web. Another way to reuse the resources is by dynamically embedding them in articles while communicating the original context eg. link to the source, parameters in which an annotation was created. Notifications can serve to establish <span id='bi-directional-linking'>bi-directional linking</span> eg. in citations.

        "\n                      <p>The data formats which are used by a notification specification must be chosen to maximise interoperability between implementations. <cite>Structure of Scholarly Information</cite> makes the argument for using <a href='#rdf-as-the-language'>RDF as the language</a> to express human- and machine-readable information on the Web. Allowing LDN actors \u2013 senders, receivers, and consumers \u2013 to handle data irrespective of the particular RDF serialisation permits flexibility, however it can also be costly to support. We take into account:</p>\n\n                      <ul>\n                        <li><em>Application interoperability</em> eg. should applications support all current RDF formats, as well as new versions or formats in the future?</li>\n                        <li><em>Maintenance of RDF parsers and serialisation libraries</em> eg. will the RDF libraries that applications use be kept up to date?</li>\n                        <li><em>Complexity of their inclusion in applications</em> eg. what are the costs or concerns of using all RDF formats?</li>\n                        <li><em>Run-time efficiency</em> eg. how well will applications perform going forward?</li>\n                      </ul>\n\n                      <p><strong>Why JSON-LD</strong>: To address these issues, choosing a single RDF serialisation to <em>require</em> is necessary for consistent interoperability, as well as keeping processing requirements or external code dependencies minimal. While any RDF notation would satisfy that need, we decided that LDN requires all applications to create and understand the JSON-LD syntax, both for the contents of Inbox as well as for individual notifications.</p>\n\n                      <p>To some extent, JSON-LD is compatible with existing JSON libraries or in some cases native programming language data structures. For example, Web browsers have a built-in interpreter for JavaScript that can handle JSON objects, that can take advantage of native object operations. Same data processing and manipulation operations are also available in a Node.js environment. Having said that, JSON-LD is a format that serves to be an RDF notation, and can also be processed as plain JSON. Hence, JSON-LD is just one convenience to certain kinds of environments that the application is confined to. JSON-LD is also advantageous in being familiar for developers who are <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='http://manu.sporny.org/2014/json-ld-origins-2/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190405035404/http://manu.sporny.org/2014/json-ld-origins-2/' data-versiondate='2019-04-05T03:54:04Z'>used to JSON-based APIs but not RDF</a></cite>.</p>\n\n                      <p><strong>Content negotiation</strong>: Optionally, applications may attempt to exchange different RDF serialisations by performing <strong>content negotiation</strong>. As in compliance with HTTP principles, a sender may make an <code>HTTP OPTIONS</code> request to the receiver to determine the RDF content types accepted by the server. A receiver can expose <code>Accept-Post</code> headers for senders, and so the sender can serialize the notification in the request body accordingly. Consumers can send <code>Accept</code> headers to receivers to signal which RDF content types they prefer and capable of processing.</p>\n\n                      <p>By mandating one RDF syntax (JSON-LD) for applications to communicate with, as well as permitting other syntaxes to discover and exchange notifications, compatibility across applications is assured.</p>\n                    "^^rdf:HTML;

The article brings forth the notion of dataspaces as a <q>data co-existence</q> approach, with the goal of providing functionality over all data source. In such systems, there is a set of participants and relationships, while remaining sensitive to their requirements of autonomy. The authors propose the development of different <q>DataSpace Support Platform</q>s (<abbr title='DataSpace Support Platform'>DSSP</abbr>) where interrelated services would allow data to be managed by participant systems.</p>

Tramp highlights that there is an increased use of centralised social platforms, where users are locked in to their respective platforms with not much opportunity to communicate easily with users on other platforms, as well as difficulty to relocate their social graphs and personal data. Interoperability between platforms being largely limited to proprietary APIs, and changes being at the discretion of the service provider. Users of the online services are being required to keep their \u2013 often overlapping \u2013 data individually at each location up to date in order to minimise divergent information. Tramp argues that technical solutions should empower users to regain control and ownership over their data and its use, ensure privacy policies and rules that\u2019s user-centric (as opposed to driven by commercial interest), increased data security, information extensibility based on user\u2019s needs, reliability through distribution, and freedom of communication without centralised control. The output of Tramp\u2019s research is that Semantic Web technologies can be deployed to some extant to support the structure, maintenance, and usage of federated and distributed social networking on the Web.

Hence, users of such systems often cannot easily switch personal data storage services, or reuse their data with similar applications. Authors demonstrate the <cite>Solid platform</cite> to address the challenges in decentralised authentication, data management, as well as the development of interoperable and portable Social Web applications that interact. A number of servers and client applications are implemented where it is possible to create, store, serve RDF and non-RDF based resources, as well as permitting operations via SPARQL queries for complex data retrieval and link-following. The client-side applications cover common "day-to-day" tasks eg. contacts management, event organisation, collaborative authoring, annotating, and social notifications, all meanwhile users are able to use their WebIDs and switch between applications with similar functions.</p>

              <p>Academic articles are commonly represented in packages, like binary file formats (PDF, Word) merging structural, presentational, and behavioural layers. Such forms are often disconnected from other knowledge, in that navigation from one unit of information to another is non-continuous or not uniformly accessible and usable by both human and machine users. This is generally due to historical policy, cost, and social or technical reasons intertwined with the systems around units of scholarly communication. One side-effect of scholarly publication still being primarily driven by the constraints of print media in this way is that it is challenging for efficient machine-readable coordination on the Web, as well as for continuous advancement of creating, communicating, and consuming information as part of the Open Web Platform.</p>

              <p>I have covered existing initiatives and progress in research, standards, and practices towards different aspects of realising a decentralised information space. Each dataspace can be individually controlled with access controls for participating agents. Different applications can be implemented to operate on the same data, as well as send activities about the interactions with the data.</p>

              <p>The implementation of dokieli is a core contribution of this thesis, and serves as a culmination of the various background research, Web standards work, and advocacy I have done so far. It is an implementation which showcases various disparate parts \u2013 Web standards, technologies, and social ideals \u2013 coming together in a cohesive way to serve a future scholarly communication ecosystem which takes full advantage of the capabilities of the Web.</p>

              <p>dokieli is not intended to be <em>the</em> solution for decentralised academic publishing and communication. My contribution is not the implementation itself, but rather the deep exploration and demonstration of how the, often complex and controversial, moving parts of the scholarly communications ecosystem can come together. What is presented here is a description of the state of the work at the time of writing. It is intended as a conceptual guide or model, and a minimum-viable baseline to be bettered by future developers and researchers. Certain development decisions were made based on existing literature, development, and observations in the relevant fields, which are discussed throughout the prior sections of this thesis. The major undertaking here was to develop dokieli with a thorough analysis of the technical possibilities of the Web <em>as well as</em> the social context in which academic researchers currently find themselves. This is not a quick-fix or a patch, but an ongoing and lengthy iterative process. It is my hope that future tooling built to support the forces and functions in decentralised scholarly communication can build upon the rationale for the ways in which dokieli is designed, and learn from the things that work and the things that do not.</p>

                  <p>By using different arrangements of LDN, WA, AP, LDP mechanisms and as well as relevant Linked Data vocabularies, scholarly and social activities can be systematically created, linked, discovered, and reused for a variety of use cases. In this section, I present an overview of <em>a</em> decentralised information space including actor profiles, notifications, and annotations. As units of information are structured and semantically interconnected, it forms a knowledge graph with the following key components with respect to technical specifications and practices:</p>

                  <p>When discussing discovery throughout this section, this means the <cite><a href='#follow-your-nose'>follow your nose</a></cite> approach of using the kinds of links listed above to find relevant services and other resources. Applications can incrementally arrange and implement a combination of these components to deliver and discover distributed activities on the Web \u2013 in a similar fashion to the <cite><a href='#paygo'>paygo</a></cite> approach. For example, the preferred locations for data storage, annotations and notifications for resources can be used as input to create new resources eg. assigning an inbox for an annotation where the inbox location is derived from a profile\u2019s preferred location for a class of information. Thereby a chain of operations can be orchestrated for decentralised units of information. This matches the notion of decoupled functions and reconstructing information flows for a unit of communication as posited in <cite><a href='#rethinking-scholarly-communication'>Rethinking Scholarly Communication</a></cite>.</p>

                  <p>dokieli is a general-purpose clientside editor for decentralised article publishing, annotations and social interactions. While it implements use cases specific to research or scholarly communication, it is not constrained to any knowledge domain or field of work. For instance, dokieli is capable of rendering the following use cases from the W3C <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709111137/https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T11:11:37Z'>RDFa Use Cases: Scenarios for Embedding RDF in HTML</a></cite>: <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-1'>Basic Structured Blogging</q>, <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-2'>Publishing an Event - Overriding Some of the Rendered Data</q>, <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-3'>Content Management Metadata</q>, <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-5'>Web Clipboard</q>, <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-7'>Advanced Data Structures</q>, and <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-8'>Augmented Browsing for Scientists</q>, <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-9'>Publishing a RDF Vocabulary</q>.

                  <p>dokieli uses <cite><a href='#linked-data-notifications'>LDN</a></cite> to send and consume notifications. For example, when a reader comments on a fragment of text in an article, the application discovers the article\u2019s Inbox and sends a notification about the annotation. dokieli also consumes notifications from this Inbox to fetch and display the annotation as marginalia (<a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='#figure-dokieli-annotation'>figure dokieli Web Annotation</a>), or indicates the back-references as in the case with citations. A reader can share a dokieli-enabled article with their contacts; dokieli discovers each contact\u2019s Inbox and sends a notification there (<a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='#figure-dokieli-share'>figure dokieli Share</a>). When editing an article, the author can add a citation. If an Inbox is discovered in the cited article, dokieli sends a notification there to indicate what part of the article was cited by whom and where. dokieli-enabled articles also consume citation notifications to display these metrics for the author and other readers (<a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='#figure-dokieli-citation'>figure dokieli Citations and Notifications</a>).</p>

                  <p>Next I describe dokieli\u2019s architecture according to the following capabilities:</p>

The content representation in HTML+RDFa that dokieli produces is accessible (readable by human and machine consumers) without requiring CSS or JavaScript, ie. text-browser safe, as well as backwards-compatible with the <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212259/https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:59Z'>WorldWideWeb</a></cite> browser.</span></p>

                          <p typeof='dio:DesignDecision' resource='#human-and-machine-interpretable' rel='dio:leadsTo' id='human-and-machine-interpretable'><strong property='schema:name'>Human- and Machine-Interpretable</strong>: <span property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'><cite><a href='#why-rdfa'>Why RDFa</a></cite> explained having all human-visible content in HTML, and all structured statements be made in context of their content in RDFa, thereby a close association between structured data and visual locality. That is, machine-readable semantics are embedded directly into human-visible prose through RDFa. dokieli applies this technique to avoid data duplication in the same document \u2013 adhering to the <abbr title='Don\u2019t Repeat Yourself'>DRY</abbr> principle. The approach also helps to avoid the creation and usage of multiple data islands, ie. separately for humans and machines. Consequently, it has the advantage of not having any dependency on JavaScript in order to make the hidden machine-readable content be consumable from a human user interface. One exception to this rule is where dokieli allows authors to embed Turtle, JSON-LD, or TriG data blocks (useful for Nanopublications) in HTML typically for the purpose of including complementary non-prose structured information. We cannot know in advance what new kinds of information or data can be integrated into articles, so to facilitate extensibility, dokieli sets no constraints on what information can be embedded nor how it can be be expressed. Hence, information can be expressed using different vocabularies, enabling reuse of existing data models and the addition of new semantic expressions.</span></p>

All articles, annotations, and notifications can be assembled in various combinations since they are ultimately expressed using the RDF language, which acts as a layer to describe them at any level of abstraction. All units of information in articles, annotations, and notifications are self-contained, context neutral, globally identifiable and accessible without additional processing. Resources can be versioned, marked as immutable, and archived, thereby treating them as stateless entities on the Web. Another way to reuse the resources is by dynamically embedding them in articles while communicating the original context eg. link to the source, parameters in which an annotation was created. Notifications can serve to establish <span id='bi-directional-linking'>bi-directional linking</span> eg. in citations. Articles and annotations can embed media objects eg. images, videos, audio, or documents, as reusable resources.</span></p>

This has the advantage that the annotation has its own inbox, which means it can stand alone and receive replies, or enable threaded conversation on the article itself.

                      <p>Before dokieli makes a write request to a server, it triggers content-negotiation through <code>HTTP OPTIONS</code> and checks for <code>Allow</code> and <code>Accept-Post</code> HTTP headers in order to determine server\u2019s preferences. In the absence of successful negotiation, dokieli proceeds to make the request as per the required parameters of LDN, WAP and AP. For example, <code>HTTP POST</code> with <code>application/ld+json</code> content type would be used for annotations and notifications, if a server\u2019s preference is not determined.</p>

                      <p>Articles are by default use HTML with embedded RDFa. Where a server implements <code>HTTP GET</code> with <code>text/html</code>, and allows <code>HTTP PUT</code> for writing, the assumption is that it can allow payloads with <code>text/html</code> content type. HTML+RDFa is considered to be an important default for articles for being human- and machine-readable. Hence, if a server is capable of storing and serving resources in HTML, it will receive articles, annotations, and notifications in that form. Otherwise, dokieli will re-serialize the content into an alternative RDF syntax that the server prefers or is capable of handling per content-negotiation.</p>

                        <p>As of this writing, the reasons to use <code>HTTP POST</code> and <code>HTTP PUT</code> over <code>HTTP PATCH</code>, for documents like articles, are as follows:</p>

                        <ul>

                          <li>Servers implementing <code>HTTP PATCH</code> with <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212300/https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:00Z'>SPARQL Update</a></cite> (using mediatype <code>application/sparql-update</code>) would also need to re-serialize the content eventually as HTML+RDFa.</li>

                          <li><code>HTTP PATCH</code> can help to optimise HTTP requests provided that the server processes the SPARQL query and eventually publishes the final state of the article. dokieli\u2019s use of <code>HTTP POST</code> and <code>HTTP PUT</code> on the other hand does not particularly expect or impose operations other than to eventually store and serve the resource.</li>

                          <li><code>HTTP POST</code> and <code>HTTP PUT</code> are functionally valid. <code>HTTP PATCH</code> can still be used in the future if server implementations can better handle updates to documents encoded in HTML+RDFa.</li>

                      <p>Annotation of artifacts facilitates a social behaviour in that it is a collaborative effort: some actors create primary resources while others create associations between those resources, add new information, or extend existing information. Consequently, such activities help actors to learn, discover or explore new knowledge. Annotations of analogue as well as digital resources have been historically essential to sociality, education, stronger engagement, as well as being a valid form of user-generated content as per background provided in <cite><a rel='cito:obtainsBackgroundFrom' href='http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november08/gazan/11gazan.html' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190502152743/http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november08/gazan/11gazan.html' data-versiondate='2019-05-02T15:27:43Z'>Social Annotations in Digital Library Collections</a></cite>, Gazan, 2008.</p>

                      <p>A Web Annotation can be created to associate a node or a selection with a particular user motivation. The annotation can be registered and stored as a unit of information at actor\u2019s <cite><a href='#profile-storage'>storage</a></cite>, <cite><a href='#profile-index'>type index location</a></cite>, <cite><a href='#profile-outbox'>outbox</a></cite>, or article\u2019s <cite><a href='#subject-annotation-service'>annotation service</a></cite>. The users can provide a text note for their annotations, assign a <cite><a href='#license'>license</a></cite>, as well as designate an <cite><a href='#subject-inbox'>inbox</a></cite> for their annotation, so that it can receive its own notifications. The Table on WA motivations includes the method applied, location of the annotation, and associated notification.</p>

                      <p>Once an annotation is created and has a dereferenceable HTTP URI (subject to access control rules), a notification can be sent to the inbox of the target resource about the annotation if any part of an article advertises an LDN inbox. Depending on the motivation of the annotation, the notification is modelled with the <cite>Activity vocabulary</cite> eg. the <a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-create'>Create</a> activity (<code>as:Create</code>), to indicate that the actor has created the object.</p>

                      <p>In order to discover and view previously created annotations associated with an article, dokieli follows LDN\u2019s discovery mechanism for notifications about annotations, and then subsequently fetches the annotations in order to display them in context of their target selector.</p>

                      <p>The mechanism for personal identities, social graphs, and self-publishing articles and annotations enables a new layer of decentralised interactions. Here I describe how actors can discover units of information created or annotated in response to Web resources (like articles) by their social network without intermediaries (which includes the authors of the article or the features supported by the server it is published at). This scenario expands on <em>identity A knows identity B</em>, and <em>identity B has a <a href='#profile-knows-profile-storage'>storage</a> or <a href='#profile-knows-profile-outbox'>outbox</a></em> as declared in <a href='#linking-the-decentralised-information-space'>Linking the Decentralised Information Space</a>.</p>

                      <p>As each unit of information can be independently published and made accessible by an actor, one way to discover the information is by determining the relation between their WebID and the location of their collection of artifacts eg. under their personal storage (<code>pim:storage</code>) or activity outbox (<code>as:outbox</code>). The second connection between the actor that is interested in discovering such information and the actors which created them (<code>foaf:knows</code>). Hence, we are able to discover the reactions (like replies, comments, approvals, questioning, or annotations in general) made by the members of an actor\u2019s social graph.</p>

                      <p>In order to realise this scenario, the required components are as follows:</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Actor A wants to read annotations or activities around a unit of information.</li>
                        <li>Actor A knows actor B.</li>
                        <li>Actor B has a collection of artifacts.</li>
                        <li>Actor A has read access to Actor B\u2019s activity collection.</li>
                        <li>Actor A\u2019s application associates the unit of interest with actor B\u2019s annotation or activity.</li>
                        <li>Actor A\u2019s application displays the annotation in context of the unit of information.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>As these components are solely based on interoperable standards, any conforming application is able to interact with them, and perhaps more importantly, is not subject to <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190729124644/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in' data-versiondate='2019-07-29T12:46:44Z'>vendor lock-in</a></cite>.</p>

                      <p>This scenario is realised in dokieli, and works as a <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='#single-page-application'>single-page application</a></cite> or via the <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='#web-browser-extension'>Web browser extension</a></cite>. The Web Extension enables a new dimension to discovering and consuming independently published activities in that, a user can navigate to any HTTP URL and potentially discover and interact with annotations made by the members of their network. Thereby, a layer of decentralised and linked research space can exist independently, where any Web resource, perhaps typically an article, can be incorporated into the social or research discourse.</p>

                      <p>As each annotation (or unit of information) can have its own inbox, subsequent interactions with the annotation can be both stored at the annotator\u2019s storage and notified at the advertised inbox. This further decouples the components required to publish and consume content on the Web in an interoperable way. The decentralised activities in dokieli demonstrates the utility of independent publishing, semantic relations, as well as extensibility of structured Web objects.</p>

                      <p>A key aspect of the Social Web is sharing our creations and interests with the others. After (optionally) authenticating with a WebID, dokieli documents can be shared with contacts, which are discovered from the user\u2019s WebID profile. Contacts whose profiles advertise an LDN Inbox will receive a notification of the share. The notification is modelled with the Activity vocabulary, eg. <a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-announce'>Announce</a>, to indicate that the actor is calling the target\u2019s attention to the object.

                      <p><cite><a href='#publishing-and-referencing'>Publishing and Referencing</a></cite> and <cite><a href='#scientific-expressions'>Scientific Expressions</a></cite> described some of the existing specifications to identify, integrate, and link assertions in research. The registration of units of information with URIs enables us to create RDF relations between citing and cited entities. For example, actors can link to specific statements within and across resources, as well as annotate their intentions while preserving the context when they are created.</p>

                      <p id='contextual-citations'><strong>Contextual Citations</strong>: One way to create a citation in dokieli is by authors selecting a node or a text fragment of interest in their document, and then inserting the URI of the resource to be linked to, as well as a specifying the type of semantic link between them in a specific or general way using the classifications available from the CiTO ontology eg. using <q>agrees with</q>, <q>confirms</q>, <q class='highlight-cites-as-evidence'>cites as evidence</q>. The input for the cited entity can be any HTTP URI, DOI string, or <abbr title='International Standard Serial Number'>ISSN</abbr> string, and when resolved from a corresponding HTTP URL, the content in RDF is used towards constructing the citation. dokieli takes the input target URI, and retrieves data (like title, authors) expressed in RDF in the linked document, integrates a statement expressed in RDF eg. figure <a href='#example-cites-as-evidence'>cites as evidence</a>, in context of the content, the citation intention as human-readable text, and adds a scientific endnote reference including the retrieved information. As a citation results in the assigning an HTTP URI for the citing entity, it can be further semantically annotated by the actor.</p>

                      <p id='notifying-cited-entity'><strong>Notifying Cited Entity</strong>: Once a citation is made through the dokieli user interface, dokieli proceeds to check if the cited resource advertises its own LDN inbox, and if so, sends a notification indicating the citation function. This notification serves as a back-reference announcement, ie. being informed that a citation was made and thus creating discoverable <em>bi-directional linking</em> between the units of information. With the help of an inbox consumer, like dokieli, the cited article can also inform the reader about the back-references out there on the Web.</p>

                      <p id='citation-registrations'><strong>Registrations</strong>: The citation activity results in the registering HTTP URIs for the citing resource, archived snapshot, and the notification resource.</p>

                      <p>It is possible to use dokieli\u2019s create operations as a composite to fulfill social and scholarly activities. One common scenario includes soliciting reviews, reviewing, announcement of the review, and final decisions made by community members. <a href='#core-mechanisms'>Core mechanisms</a>, <a href='#annotations'>annotations</a> and <a href='#sharing-resources'>sharing resources</a> in dokieli is as follows:</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Actor A publishes their article at preferred location.</li>
                        <li>Actor A sends Actor B a notification requesting a review of their article.</li>
                        <li>Actor B creates a derived copy of Actor A\u2019s article at their preferred location. The derived resource optionally includes its own inbox and annotation service.</li>
                        <li>Actor B reviews and annotates the derived resource by storing their annotations at preferred location. Notifications are sent to the inbox about the annotation.</li>
                        <li>Actor B archives their derived copy with annotations.</li>
                        <li>Actor B sends Actor A a notification sharing the location of the annotated resource.</li>
                        <li>Actor A visits Actor B\u2019s derived resource and discovers the review and annotations.</li>
                        <li>Actor B sends a notification to a community inbox that is dedicated to monitor scholarly activities about their review and annotations so that it can be discovered by other actors.</li>
                        <li>Actor C discovers Actor B\u2019s review through the community inbox.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>This particular scenario shows that it is possible for each actor to create and control resources, including articles, annotations, and notifications at their PDS or preferred locations. It is one way to combine standards-compliant mechanisms where actors can shape their content, self-publish, as well as share their works with other actors and services. In essence, the registration, certification, awareness, and archiving functions in scholarly communication are fulfilled in this scenario without a central authority.</p>

                    <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                      <p>Creating awareness and enabling actors to protect their data privacy is essential to fostering user\u2019s trust in the systems they use. The adoption of standards and practices with different <a href='#degree-of-control'>degree of control</a> can yield different privacy measures. In the decentralised and interoperable environment that dokieli operates in, there are a number of challenges and approaches. I discuss user privacy, data privacy, preferred proxy, and private activities below. The terms <q>anonymity</q>, <q>unlinkability</q>, <q>undetectability</q>, <q>unobservability</q>, and <q>pseudonymity</q> follow the definitions from <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='http://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.34.pdf' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190128120631/http://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.34.pdf' data-versiondate='2019-01-28T12:06:31Z'>A terminology for talking about privacy by data minimization: Anonymity, Unlinkability, Undetectability, Unobservability, Pseudonymity, and Identity Management</a></cite>, Pfitzmann, 2010.</p>

                      <p id='user-privacy'><strong>User Privacy</strong>: dokieli acts as a conduit to perform read-write operations against <abbr title='Personal Data Store'>PDS</abbr>. As the rules for read-write operations are set by servers, dokieli does not require the creation of user accounts at any server, in order to interact with the server\u2019s resources. Where applicable, actors can participate by maintaining their <em>anonymity</em>, <em>pseudonymity</em>, or can choose to identify themselves to dokieli by using their preferred <a href='#personal-identities'>personal identities</a>, without necessarily disclosing "real" information. Actors authenticate against the servers they prefer in order to perform access-controlled actions. It is possible for the environment in which dokieli operates in to transmit device, machine, or browser fingerprint, thereby potentially risking <em>unlinkability</em> \u2013 however, they are outside the control and scope of dokieli.</p>

                      <p id='data-privacy'><strong>Data Privacy</strong>: With respect to data privacy, actors can exercise their autonomy through the use of PDS for their profiles, articles, annotations, and notifications. As a <a href='#pds-expectation'>PDS can provide</a> us with the means to safeguard data, dokieli as a clientside application enables actors to perform <a href='#read-write-linked-data'>read-write Linked Data</a> operations where they prefer under their own conditions. With the help of access controls, a PDS that dokieli communicates with can potentially fulfill all minimizations \u2013 <q>anonymity</q>, <q>unlinkability</q>, <q>undetectability</q>, <q>unobservability</q>, <q>pseudonymity</q> \u2013 possibly with the exception of the domain name and IP that the PDS operates from.</p>

                      <p id='preferred-proxy'><strong>Preferred Proxy</strong>: A proxy acts as an intermediary between the clientside application and the destination server. This is useful in a number of scenarios for dokieli, such as getting around <a href='#mixed-content'>Mixed Content</a> issues, absence of <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212302/https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:02Z'>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</a></cite> (<abbr title='Cross-Origin Resource Sharing'>CORS</abbr>) support, as well as concealing the identity of the actor, fulfilling <em>anonymity</em>, <em>unlinkability</em>, <em>pseudonymity</em>, when making requests to a target server. An actor\u2019s preferred proxy can be determined by checking their WebID Profile description for the <code>solid:preferredProxy</code> relation, and if found, dokieli can use it to route requests when needed. Alternatively, a built-in (but user configurable) proxy location in dokieli is used.</p>

                      <p id='private-activities'><strong>Private Activities</strong>: The ability for actors to create and discover <a href='#activities'>activities</a> made within their social network without going through intermediaries, makes it possible to isolate units of information that is both access-controlled and invisible (or be unknown) to third-parties. These class of interactions in dokieli is aligned with the notion of <em>undetectability</em> and <em>unobservability</em>.</p>

                      <p>dokieli is a clientside application that uses the user-agent to interact with server applications. It has two deployment approaches including the same set of features: <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:02Z'>single-page application</a></cite> and <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_extension' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_extension' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:02Z'>Web browser extension</a></cite>.</p>

                      <p id='single-page-application'>dokieli\u2019s presentational and behavioural code layers can be included in Web "pages" in order to trigger them as active single-page applications. It is a smart client that allows different kinds of articles eg. academic, blog posts, news, to be authored and annotated from within Web browsers, without necessarily having them deployed from a server, ie. it can be used offline or on localhost. dokieli internally handles its content and structural and semantic representation based on user\u2019s actions and available information. Articles, profiles and their contact information, notifications, annotations with different motivations, for instance, can be read and written ubiquitously to any Web space with supporting HTTP methods and access control mechanisms.</p>

                      <p id='web-browser-extension'>The Web browser extension is a thin wrapper around dokieli\u2019s core code in order to embed itself in any HTML-based Web page on the Web. It inherits all of the features of a single-page application. While HTML based documents on the Web vary in their quality, dokieli\u2019s write operations generate HTML+RDFa. One of the utilities for the extension is to have a consistent interface for annotating node or text selections on a Web resource, building structured citations, creating derivations of Web resources as well as sharing document fragments with ones contacts via notifications, without having a service dependency or being limited by the Web page\u2019s UI.</p>

With an ontology and a user interface appropriate for the type of content, semantic authoring can be easier than traditional composition of content and the resulting content can be of higher quality.</q> The article proposes a set of <q>quality attributes</q> \u2013 as non-functional requirements \u2013 to evaluate the performance of SCA systems: usability, customizability, generalizability, collaboration, portability, accessibility, proactivity, automation, evolvability, interoperability, and scalability. Based on the starting point of the authoring process, the authors distinguish the approaches, and generally categorised as <q>bottom-up</q> (lifting unstructured content to a semantic level) or <q>top-down</q> (semantic representations from the beginning requiring users with the knowledge of the domain), and sometimes a hybrid of the two. A survey of tools are presented (in article\u2019s Table 3) covering different types of users, expected domain knowledge, and authoring approach. The article also discusses <cite>Research and Technology Challenges</cite> and identifies a gap in addressing <q>accessibility</q>, <q>handling complexity in UIs</q>, <q>formal and systematic methods for user interface evaluation</q>, <q>heuristic evaluation</q>, <q>support of crowdsourcing</q>, UIs for ubiquitous devices.</p>

                  <p>The scope of SCA is relevant because it covers some of the aspects of dokieli that can be examined. Hence, I use the structure of the table of results for SCA systems and include a dataset about <cite><a href='#quality-attributes-dokieli'>dokieli\u2019s quality attributes</a></cite>:</p>

I have also looked at the ongoing initiatives towards the decoupling of functions in scientific communication. Here I reuse some of these notions to situate dokieli with some existing work that can be (subjectively) <em>considered as representative</em> for different areas in <q>Web publishing</q>. There is plethora of examples for centralised and decentralised systems on the Web. Some of the authoring and publishing systems already fulfill some aspects of decentralised systems which operate over HTTP. I focus on degree of control with respect to applications, data and identity, privacy, accessibility, and interoperability.</p>

Annotations may be private, public, or for a group, and can be threaded to form conversations around a piece of content. Each instance of a client application is preconfigured to use its own API endpoint against a particular server to perform CRUD operations, such as creating and finding annotations and related data. Actors use the client application to control the user accounts at a server or preconfigured identity providers eg. hypothes.is, orcid.org, acknowledged by a server. Annotations can be self-hosted, however different servers do not federate. The HTML representations of annotations requires JavaScript to be available and enabled on the user-agent in order to look up and fetch the annotation\u2019s contents in JSON from its API and update the <abbr title='Document Object Model'>DOM</abbr>. The annotation URLs, proxy, and the browser extension uses the <cite>Google Analytics</cite> tracking service per active URL. On active URLs, the client application by default makes API calls to the Hypothes.is server to check for annotations. On-demand archiving services like the Internet Archive are currently unable to properly archive an annotation\u2019s contents. It is possible to fetch an annotation that is represented with the WA Data Model from a server, however the annotation is not machine-discoverable ie. other applications will need to be uniquely configured with Hypothes.is\u2019s annotation URL template in order to acquire a JSON-LD representation - which is semantically a subset of the information provided in the HTML and JSON representations.</p>

                      <p>One common architectural aspect to these systems is that while they have some characteristics of a loosely coupled system, the server is expected to work with a designated client application. For instance, they require account creation and data storage with respect to an appointed centralised service. In essence, the user interface is restricted to communicate with a particular service endpoint, as well as an authority that governs all actor identities and the data they have produced. They allow multiple participants to annotate and hold discussions around the primary content; users must access their accounts to be notified of updates to conversations, and data from both the main content and related discussion is confined to the service which was used to create it. The data formats and schemas are consistent across storage instances in that it is possible to migrate data from one location to another using the same server application, storage mechanism and data schema. Archivability of Web resources varies and their access being at the discretion of server owners.</p>

The client application was integrated into Amaya where it was able to store and recall annotations locally or from a remote annotation server, with the expectation of an access controlled server using the standard HTTP authentication mechanisms. Annotea annotations are independent Web resources. Annotea has a <cite><a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/User/Protocol.html' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212307/https://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/User/Protocol.html' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:07Z'>protocol</a></cite> that specifies the CRUD operations for servers and clients, and enables different applications to be built. Annotea in Amaya for instance allowed the user to specify the URI of an annotation server. In order to reference target resources, annotations used <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-element/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212307/https://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-element/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:07Z'>XML Pointer Language</a></cite> (<abbr title='XML Pointer Language'>XPointer</abbr>) to specify the part of HTML or XML-based documents that the annotation was in context of.

                      <p>Amaya and Annotea emerged at a time when publishing and consumption standards on the Open Web Platform were still relatively in the early phases. The most apparent conceptual similarities between the Amaya and Annotea combination with dokieli is that they treat the hosting document as one of the environments to perform read and write operations from.</p>

                      <hr></hr>

                      <p id='dokieli-hypothes.is'>A tentative view of the interoperability between Hypothes.is and dokieli is as follows. The client applications Hypothes.is and dokieli are non-conflicting in that when used in the same content or context, each can still be used on its own. A Hypothes.is client application can search and fetch annotations from an associated server using the Hypothes.is API, and render them on the target resource. dokieli can discover the WA annotation service of a Web resource, fetch annotations from servers conforming to WAP and LDP specifications, and render them on the target resource. Additional data about the annotation can be created and reused in both applications. A Hypothes.is client application can authenticate with a particular server using OAuth. Actors with WebID in dokieli can authenticate with servers supporting WebID-TLS and WebID-OIDC. Both can create annotations given authorization. Hypothes.is application can extend and direct annotations to a community group using the same server. dokieli triggers content negotiation with servers to determine preferred RDF serialization of Web Annotation and profile. The Hypothes.is client can only fetch annotations from a corresponding Hypothes.is server. dokieli can only fetch annotations from servers implementing LDP, WAP or AP. Putting the method of fetching an annotation resource aside, it is possible for either client application to render an annotation serialized as JSON-LD that is created by the other application. The notion of "private" content in Hypothes.is is tied to the annotation server that client application is associated with, whereas "private" content in dokieli is associated to actor\u2019s preferred storage location and access control policies based on individual, class of, or group WebIDs.</p>

                      <p>Existing server and client applications in particular to authoring and publishing are complex systems in that while they adhere or adopt some aspects of open Web specifications, they also include proprietary designs. Such systems also have varying characteristics of centralisation and decentralisation, hence, while some aspects are interoperable, other areas require post facto efforts to interop.</p>

                      <p>The tools which provide good collaborative editing user-interfaces appear to do so at the expense of data ownership and interoperability; those which promote creation and publication of data in open reusable formats are lacking facilities for linking discourse and conversation to concepts published. Decentralised creations also mean that each author can choose their own semantics eg. their own vocabulary to annotate using the RDF language, and then such decentralised documents can link to each other and their schemas can also be mapped to each other, whereas in centralised systems this is (if they support structured semantics at all) often prescribed, either technically enforced, or encouraged by social convention.</p>

                      <p>Future work can examine how additional features can be realised on top of existing Web standards, or where more development is required. Real-time collaborative editing is often realised with centralised communication (even though some peer to peer alternatives exist).

                      <p>dokieli shows that it is possible for people to interact with each other without central coordination. Users can choose storage space for their content independently of the applications with which they edit and view that content. Documents are connected statically through links and dynamically through Linked Data Notifications. This is a proof for the viability of a social and decentralised authoring and annotation environment based on Web standards. dokieli happens to be one application that demonstrates the potentials of decentralised notifications and annotations. The information it creates does not result in a vendor lock-in, as other applications are able to reuse them \u2013 given agreement on using open Web standards.</p>

                      <p>On the other hand, dokieli\u2019s use of standards shows that dokieli itself is only one means to an end: once the document has been created, it lives on independently. The <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_machine' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105639/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_machine' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:39Z'>social machine</a></cite> consists of people and documents, connected by Web standards, with dokieli acting as just one possible catalyst. Different Web applications can incorporate any of dokieli\u2019s functions and implement the principles to varying extent. Since the data is decoupled from the application, we avoid the <em>walled garden</em> problem of current social platforms today, as well as various forms of vendor lock-in with some applications, even if they are are operating in a loosely coupled environment. In essence, it is possible to swap dokieli with another client application and still communicate with any standards-compliant server. This is one of the key steps to liberating actors to create and share without setting burdens on URI, data and application control.</p>

                      <p>A couple of important sociotechnical challenges remain, and implications on autonomy. Resources might want to indicate in a granular way which actions they support or encourage, such as assessments, bookmarking, or sharing, and perhaps conditions about which notifications should be sent when any of these events take place. In order to encourage positive behaviour, we might want ways to provide moderation, and solutions to prevent harassment and abuse. Closely related is the issue of identity, pseudonymity and anonymity, and its relation with trust and verification. There are also social implications of dokieli\u2019s Web browser extension and social graph. For instance, the ability of annotating and sharing information even if the primary article does not have an inbox or an annotation service. There is no administrator that oversees everything, but that each actor has control privileges to what they are given. Having the ability to annotate anything and stored at a preferred location enables actor autonomy. This can be contrasted with annotation systems that may restrict annotations from getting created with particular targets or annotations having particular information in its body.</p>

As per the client\u2013server model, their arrangement generally falls in the spectrum of tightly or loosely coupled architectures. In these systems, actors control client applications typically through user-agents. The degree of coupling that is exerted on the system varies depending on the class of components involved. More specifically, <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='http://www2009.eprints.org/92/1/p911.pdf' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190529163945/http://www2009.eprints.org/92/1/p911.pdf' data-versiondate='2019-05-29T16:39:45Z'>Why is the Web Loosely Coupled? A Multi-Faceted Metric for Service Design</a></cite>, Pautasso, 2009, proposes <q>discovery, identification, binding, platform, interaction, interface orientation, model, granularity, state, evolution, generated code, conversation</q> as metrics for the degree of coupling in service-oriented systems.</p>\n\n                  <p id='webid-loose-coupling'>Loose coupling reduces the number of assumptions each party makes about the other when exchanging information. For instance, AWWW includes various protocols for interaction, URIs to identify, and standard data formats to communicate the content. The Linked Data design principles then sets further constraints within this framework by favouring HTTP URIs, and the RDF language. A Linked Data driven system using uniform interaction and information exchange can be viewed to be more tightly coupled in comparison to an arbitrary system that is less specified or unspecified. Corollary, the loosely coupled systems set a higher requirement for using Web specifications emerging through open consensus as well as being widely deployed in order for the ecosystem to function. Otherwise, it would be impossible to communicate if there is no higher-order agreement. The loose coupling of interoperable systems based on open standards however can go beyond the arrangement of clients and servers. For instance, the notion of WebID enables loose coupling of identity, identification, authentication, authorization, and storage.</p>\n\n                  <p id='decentralised-datastore'><strong>Decentralised datastore</strong> (or dataspaces) under the custodian of different actors implicates organic growth and operation as a by product of autonomous operation. In contrast to third-party controlled centralised systems, decentralised systems can have persistent availability (globally), resistance to external censorship, monopoly disruption, increased interest in privacy and security, and enable free expression with respect to information structure and semantics. In order for decentralised datastores to be effective, both servers and client application have an increased requirement on implementing consensus-based open standards in order to cultivate an interoperable ecosystem.</p>\n\n                  <p id='shared-hosting'><strong>Shared hosting</strong> refers to a kind of <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_web_hosting_service' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190729124643/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_web_hosting_service' data-versiondate='2019-07-29T12:46:43Z'>web hosting service</a></cite> where the server\u2019s resources are shared among its users. While the hosting has usage limits, it is considered to be economical and have reliability features put in place by the host\u2019s system administrators. Any website with its own domain name can act as an independent node in a decentralised system. However, given that multiple websites reside on the same server, system-wide configuration changes or disruptions on the network usually effects all of the websites. Moreover, there are privacy and security concerns if the information on or transferring through individual dataspaces are not encrypted. Hence, the user places their trust on the hosting service\u2019s administrators.</p>\n\n                  <p id='pds'><strong>Personal data service</strong> (or store) (<abbr title='Personal Data Service'>PDS</abbr>), <em>personal online datastore</em> (<abbr title='Personal Online Datastore'>POD</abbr>) or <q>pod</q> as a noun, loosely refer to an individual-operated Web space with mechanisms for data storage and management that is capable of providing access-controlled read-write operations for independently built interoperable applications. A generic PDS can be virtually realised with any HTTP server with varying configurations and capabilities offering client-side applications to communicate through open protocols and data formats. Web resources that are only intended for public read entails that the custodian allows resources to be available in response to client requests. Servers would need to factor in an authentication mechanism and authorization rules to determine who to serve the resources to and under which access constraints. A client-server interaction based on a read-write Linked Data architecture has affordances for distributed and semantically interconnected Web resources.</p>\n\n                  <p id='pds-expectation'>The concepts above generally fall into the spectrum of <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(web_services)' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190620000203/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(web_services)' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:48Z'>self-hosting</a></cite> for Web space management. An individual responsible for a PDS entails that they are responsible as well as accountable of its operation, abilities, policies and practice decisions on data, persistence strategies and so forth. PDS makes it possible for actors to safeguard their data by setting authentication and authorization rules for any or class of agents, being able to act as the source of truth for WebIDs and the descriptions in the profiles. Running a PDS fundamentally requires the system to fulfill the registration function for the content it makes available. As archiving is an external function, we expect other services to meet that requirement. The certification function can be fulfilled in a similar manner to registration in that the actors that are involved in the quality-control process can register their own units of information in their PDS in response to target units.</p>\n                "^^rdf:HTML;

                <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                  <p>Throughout history, the complex connections between communication technologies and society transformed control structures of civilisations. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Innis'>Harold Innis</a> and Marshall McLuhan argued that electronic media, unlike any other, compressed time and space, creating a <q cite='http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/993539009'>global village</q> as well as facilitating the influence and potential of centralised control.</p>

                  <p id='cyberspace-independence'>While the Internet reinforces democratic (re)distribution of communicative power, and the Web is inherently a decentralised social system, centralisation of all forms of information exchange and various forms of censorship \u2013 state or self-imposed \u2013 still occurs. In response to the <cite>Telecommunications Act of 1996</cite>, John Perry Barlow voiced a fundamental societal concern in <cite><a rel='cito:obtainsBackgroundFrom' href='https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20180828220312/https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence' data-versiondate='2018-08-28T22:03:12Z'>A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</a></cite> given the attempts of the <q>governments of the industrial world</q> to exert control over it, the builders of the cyberspace; a self-sovereign online society that is cross- border, culture, with diverse economies is ultimately an opposing force.</p>

                  <p id='information-control'>Over the years, large-scale centralised systems were built to collect, organise and share data in diverse sectors. The domination of centralisation is essentially due to economic and state incentives, and it has shaped the technical infrastructure: it is currently much easier and more efficient to author, manage, publish, read, and search large amounts of content using centralised services or proprietary platforms. As such the convenience that comes with centralisation is at the user\u2019s expense where ownership and access control is compromised, and ultimately the user\u2019s privacy and security. Moreover, from the service provider\u2019s perspective, there is no particular incentive to build interoperable systems as that would entail losing control over data. Since such services hinder information flow; information in one service is not necessarily usable by other applications and services and vice versa, they effectively form information silos \u2013 <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2008/Papers/MSNWS/index.html' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20180830094126/http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2008/Papers/MSNWS/index.html' data-versiondate='2018-08-30T09:41:26Z'>Decentralization: The Future of Online Social Networking</a></cite>, 2008.</p>

                  <p>In addition to state controlled network infrastructures, information empires like <cite>Google</cite>, <cite>Facebook</cite>, <cite>Amazon</cite>, <cite>Elsevier</cite>, as well as a long tail of (social media) services, exert a great deal of influence on how information can be accessed, expressed and reused. This influence impacts society, affecting the cost of accessing information, the effort required to produce and distribute, long-standing privacy concerns (in exchange of some convenience for users), as well as how and the amount of information that is aggregated, shared and filtered.</p>

                  <p id='trusting-centralised-services'>Independence from centralised services and platforms is a necessity for ownership of published ideas, and to establish authenticity and trust. For example, <cite>Facebook</cite> has been accused of <a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal'>data scandals</a>, <a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2016/05/yes_facebook_is_biased_now_it_should_admit_it.html'>bias</a>, <a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/12/how-technology-disrupted-the-truth'>false information</a>, and <a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/technology/facebook-vietnam-war-photo-nudity.html'>censorship</a> \u2013 but rather than blaming this on any particular service or platform, we identify it as an unavoidable result of centralisation. After all, there is a continued tension between unrestricted publication rights on the one hand, and a guarantee of balanced, verified information on the other. In a fully decentralised setting, each source is filterless and responsible for its own quality and reputation, while consumers are free to selectively (dis-)trust certain sources using any mechanism they desire, for example through trusted parties. This can have both favourable and unfavourable consequences depending on actual implementations. <cite>Google Search</cite> or <cite><a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://duckduckgo.com/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212227/https://duckduckgo.com/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:27Z'>DuckDuckGo</a></cite> for instance apply different filtering algorithms based on their Web crawls. Whether consciously or not, why we use a particular search engine naturally correlates with the amount of use or trust we have on that system. Similarly, as the academic peer review system acts as a layer to regulate credibility of academic contributions, we can approach the research results provided that there is sufficient provenance, accountability of the quality control processes, and able to distinguish different levels of certification given or lack of from the scholarly community.</p>

                  <p id='situation-challenges'>With the presumption that the major external forces \u2013 governments, companies \u2013 are at play, the situation for individual-controlled communication is complicated and ever challenging. Given that academic research is a global activity, it is important to acknowledge that the Web enables an environment in which actors in the space can both autonomously conduct their endeavours and participate in knowledge exchange. Hence, there is a need to <em>re-decentralise the Web</em> so that it benefits individuals, the public, as well as the scholarly communication market as a whole. We need to improve decentralisation and take further steps to apply it to research activities and scholarly publishing.</p>

                  <p id='knowledge-commons'>The information needs of individuals, communities and societies vary on personal, local and global levels.

Through electronic knowledge representations, researchers can take part in reproducing and replicating others\u2019 findings; be involved in quality-control and certification processes, as well as incorporate interactions among researchers, examiners, journalists, policy makers, and the general public. Given access to the Internet and the Web, academic researchers can register their URIs, and control how they express their ideas and what they refer to, establish data storage and choose which applications to use for their social and scholarly activity.</p>

                  <p>Messages and operations in centralised or distributed systems <q>may be managed by a single root of trust or authority</q>. From this position <q>decentralized systems are a subset of distributed systems</q> where they <q>embody a complex set of relationships of trust between parties managing different aspects of the system</q>. These systems are conceived of as a graph where the nodes correspond to the components of the system, and the edges correspond to connections between them. From a global perspective, the Web is a decentralised system, however, it can have components which are disjoint from the rest of the graph. Figure <cite><a href='#figure-centralised-decentralised-architectures'>Coupling of Centralised and Decentralised Architectures</a></cite> depicts the contrast between typical centralised and decentralised architectures.</p>

Tramp highlights that there is an increased use of centralised social platforms, where users are locked in to their respective platforms with not much opportunity to communicate easily with users on other platforms, as well as difficulty to relocate their social graphs and personal data. Interoperability between platforms being largely limited to proprietary APIs, and changes being at the discretion of the service provider. Users of the online services are being required to keep their \u2013 often overlapping \u2013 data individually at each location up to date in order to minimise divergent information.

The following are a selection of open Web specifications; standards and practices that are designed with the notion of decentralisation, interoperability, and extensibility. They are based on use cases that facilitate discovery, read-write operations of interlinked Web resources.</p>

                  <p>Both Tramp and Sambra approach from the perspective that the Web has proven itself architecturally and universality, and argue to extend the decentralised architecture for information reuse and user interaction. The core approaches use the Linked Data technology stack for publishing, retrieval, and integration; decoupling services and applications from the users data so that content creators are owners and have desired rights on their data and its use; and fostering data extensibility and distribution, as well as privacy.</p>

                  <p id='internet-web-protocols'>The foundational communication and transfer protocols of the Internet and the Web are designed to operate in a decentralised and distributed manner. In terms of global functionality, removing a single node from the network \u2013 a machine with an IP address \u2013 does not halt the whole network. Similarly, when an HTTP URL is no longer available (eg. typical "404 Not Found", "410 Gone" status messages), the other URLs are not directly affected. This particular behaviour, where the Web being functional without requiring bi-directional hyperlinks is considered to be a "feature" (rather than a "bug") of the overall system. In the meantime, bi-directional links can still be established when so desired eg. as in the case with notifications.</p>

This is all meanwhile technically and legally enabling participants to retain their autonomy, identity and storage, access and rights over their contributions. In order to achieve this, one of the goals is to make an infrastructure where data and applications are decoupled by design. That is, an ability to work with Linked Data without constraints on which applications can be used, as long as they follow consensus-based open protocols and data models. At the core of this initiative is where users, groups, and applications use global identifiers (URIs), and  access control is applied using policies assigned to those identifiers. This also leads to the commodification of read-write data storage; the storage location on the Web can be decided by its owners and contributors, and it remains independent from the applications interacting with it.</p>

To this end, templating is where an HTTP operation is mapped to a certain URI pattern that a server executes a SPARQL command in order to drive RDF processing. When a client triggers a particular request pattern, the server gives a suitable response based on available templates that are identified with URIs.

                  <p>One of the functions of an online identity is to a identify a persisting entity at a particular time and context. The construction of an online identity of an entity eg. individual, organisation, community, state, can be complex in that it is interconnected with social and technical systems, and it can be issued \u2013 declared to exist, named, or be referenceable \u2013 in different ways. Entities being universally and uniquely identifiable on or off the Web entails that they can be attributed for their contributions, develop their reputations, be accountable for their actions and research output, as well as play an integral role towards building trust. An actor is an indispensable force in research communication, and enabling identity agency is both relevant and foundational.</p>

                  <p id='third-party-controlled-identity'><strong>Third-party controlled identity</strong>: Community or state controlled identifiers for identities are a class of identifiers that are ultimately third-party controlled in that their ownership, governance, description is beyond an individual\u2019s jurisdiction. The creation and control of identifiers by a group has the quality of long-term promise for persistence. Typically there are policies in place which promise their longevity, and procedures in the event that the group ceases to manage the identifiers. For example, ORCID URIs are intended to be part of the scholarly commons where they managed by the <cite><a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://orcid.org/about/community' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190729124641/https://orcid.org/about/community' data-versiondate='2019-07-29T12:46:41Z'>ORCID community</a></cite>. The ORCID URI and profile description is useful to researchers, organisations, as well as to interlink researcher objects, however it is ultimately intended to serve the research community, and the systems that use it. One unintended consequence of this kind of centralisation in scholarly communication is that a growing number of institutions and publishers require researchers to participate with their ORCID identifiers, as opposed to any URI of a researcher. The resulting effects of <cite><a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://orcid.org/content/requiring-orcid-publication-workflows-open-letter' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190729124642/https://orcid.org/content/requiring-orcid-publication-workflows-open-letter' data-versiondate='2019-07-29T12:46:42Z'>such initiatives</a></cite> are counter to autonomous participation in that a researcher has to conform to the terms and policies of multiple third-parties. On the other hand, the administration of the URI by the ORCID organisation removes the burden of maintaining the URI as well as the profile URL. In this case, a "trusted" third-party takes care of the identifier, whereas researchers are responsible of updating the content.</p>

                  <p id='researcher-identifier-academic-freedom'>While some scholarly societies adopt identifiers like ORCID given their agreed potential benefits, it can also be harmful in the case of tracking researchers; where they work, who they work for or collaborate with, what they work on. Such ease of identification opens up the possibility to target and surveil researchers, as well as to discriminate or exile them if their findings act counter to others\u2019 interests. <cite><a rel='cito:includesQuotationFrom' href='http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-March/004432.html' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190504211839/http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-March/004432.html' data-versiondate='2019-05-04T21:18:39Z'>[GOAL] eLife collects ORCIDs from authors of accepted papers at proofing</a></cite>, Morrison, 2017, argues that <q cite='http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-March/004432.html'>it is not clear that facilitating researcher identification is in the best interests of academic freedom \u2026 participation in a service like ORCID should be optional</q>. <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://www.codyh.com/writing/tracking.html' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190409203140/https://www.codyh.com/writing/tracking.html' data-versiondate='2019-04-09T20:31:40Z'>User Tracking on Academic Publisher Platforms</a></cite>, Hanson, 2019, studied 15 different publisher sites and found that on average, each had 18 third-party assets loaded, with a total of 139 distinct third-parties across the platforms.

The collected user data is shared with ad networks and data brokers. Unauthorised third-party tracking of users online activities is particularly concerning even in the case of <em>public sector</em> websites, which are expected to be more privacy respecting than "ordinary" websites (as per <abbr title='General Data Protection Regulation'>GDPR</abbr> in the EU). For example, <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://www.cookiebot.com/media/1121/cookiebot-report-2019-medium-size.pdf' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190318102156/https://www.cookiebot.com/media/1121/cookiebot-report-2019-medium-size.pdf' data-versiondate='2019-03-18T10:21:56Z'>Ad Tech Surveillance on the Public Sector Web</a></cite>, Cookiebot, 2019, reports that advertising technology (ad tech) companies are extensively tracking EU citizens using government and public health service websites \u2013 <q cite='https://www.cookiebot.com/media/1121/cookiebot-report-2019-medium-size.pdf'>a total of 112 companies were identified using trackers that send data to a total of 131 third party tracking domains</q>. Thus, behavioural data combined with third-party identifiers in any shape or form (including syncing across services) is in breach of individual\u2019s privacy in many jurisdictions.</p>

                  <p id='self-controlled-identity'><strong>Self-controlled identity</strong>: The concept of a personal self-sovereign identity entails that entities can register, describe, and manage their own identities of their choice. Controlling our online identities is important because it reflects our individuality and privacy.

                  <p id='identity-http-uri'>Different types of strings, eg. a username, an email address, an RSA public key, a URI, can be used to directly or indirectly identify agents. While each can be useful within their own context, Web-based identifiers (HTTP URI) make it possible to provide machine-readable descriptions when dereferenced, descriptions being extensible by their owners, as well as being interoperable global identifiers that can be interlinked unambiguously with other things.</p>

                  <p id='identity-privacy-spectrum'>A server can collect information about a client based on its device, machine, or browser fingerprint, even if the user did not directly disclose information about themselves. On the other hand, global identifiers like government-issued identifiers, credit card numbers, and full names, can be used to determine, track, and correlate an entity.</p>

WebID is distributed and decentralised in that any agent can be <em>named</em> anywhere on the Web, and the server hosting the URI space controls the identity.

                  <p id='multiple-identities'><strong>Multiple identities</strong>: Individuals may want to be associated with multiple identities to fulfill diverse needs and social expectations. For instance, academics, politicians, employees, and artists, to name a few, may want to perform their online activities using public identifiers, so that they can be discovered, attributed, rewarded, trusted etc. There can also be quasi-public identities issued by a government or a bank to connect individuals to the physical world. Furthermore, individuals may wish to have several personal \u2013 public or private \u2013 identities and self representations, eg. on social networks, to address different needs. At any event, identities and corresponding identifiers can be registered and managed by different entities, and may be interlinked.</p>

                  <p id='orcid-sameas-webid'>For instance, while ORCID profile description has constraints, it allows extensibility in the form of asserting a "same as" relation through its UI, so that the ORCID URI can be linked to other WebIDs. This essentially makes a connection to another <cite><a href='#self-describing'>self-describing document</a></cite> and facilitates <cite><a href='#follow-your-nose'>follow your nose</a></cite> discovery. My personal WebID which is under my control is <a href='https://csarven.ca/#i'>https://csarven.ca/#i</a>. I also have an ORCID identifier that also serves as a WebID: <a href='https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0880-9125'>https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0880-9125</a> which also has an RDF representation. As ORCID\u2019s user interface allows people to extend their descriptions with certain fields, it is possible to add <em>same as</em> or <em>preferred URI</em> relations:</p>

                  <p id='linking-identities'>The <code class='highlight-predicate-sameas'>owl:sameAs</code> and <code>contact:preferredURI</code> information provides an opportunity for applications consuming the ORCID WebID to potentially discover more information about other entities. This is particularly useful as the ORCID WebID Profile is not completely open to add arbitrary information. For example, specifying a person\u2019s picture or their contacts is not currently possible with ORCID, however, if the alternative profiles (https://csarven.ca/#i) contain such information, they can be purposed to know more about the entity.</p>

                  <p id='social-graph'><strong>Social Graph</strong>: Identity profiles can further describe their relationships to other identities and hence form a network of self-described profiles. This is useful in that relationships between profiles of people, groups, organisations, and even software agents can manifest an information space that at its core has social affordances. That is, different kinds of relationships between entities can be expressed for different use cases, where each identity is independently controlled by its owners. For example:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>identifying a layer of trusted (or acknowledged) network of people</li>
                    <li>sending notifications to the members of one\u2019s personal social graph</li>
                    <li>discovering annotations made by a particular social graph</li>

                  <p id='trust'>Trust is ultimately tied to verifiable claims about identity and their provenance. While the creation and protection of third-party controlled online identities have received much focus, claiming and using personal identities online is still a challenge. Today\u2019s Web applications predominantly make use of online identities that are essentially tied to and controlled by authorities in which users are merely borrowing an identifier and its management. It is a common practice to where users are required to create accounts at each online service they wish to use, eg. social media sites. Moreover, the trust model of such design dictates claims and usage of online identities is not ultimately in the hands of the users, and can be taken away from the users by the owners of the URIs and service at any time and reason. Even in cases where third-party issues identities can be used across different services, it is subject to a privacy violation as the identity provider essentially gets to know which services the user\u2019s online identity is used with and for what purpose. Consequently such services can gradually build up information about users\u2019 actions as well as behavioural patterns on the Web. Lastly, portability and interoperability of the identities is generally under developed as there is no particular incentive for an identity provider to make it so \u2013 after all, providing \u201cfree\u201d services for online identities, and then locking identities to well-defined circle of services is taken advantage of by large corporations given their business models. Perhaps most importantly, such online services (as well as applications) do not recognise the identity of users as a distinct notion from the applications and services they use towards authentication.</p>

A public key cryptographic system uses a pair of keys: public keys (disseminated openly) and private keys (withheld by the owner). It has two main functions: authentication and encryption. For authentication, public key verifies that a holder of the paired private key sent the message. In the case of encryption, for example, when Guinan wants to send Picard a message, Guinan takes Picard\u2019s public key to encrypt a message where only Picard can decrypt the message with his private key.

As the extension mechanism in X.509 allows additional statements to be specified under the <code>Subject Alternative Name</code> (<abbr title='Subject Alternative Name'>SAN</abbr>) field, it is used to declare the user\u2019s WebID for the <code>URI</code> field. When a client application running on the Web browser requests a resource from the server, the TLS connection gets established between them. Once TLS has been set up, the HTTP application protocol exchange takes place (eg. <code>HTTP GET</code>, <code>HTTP POST</code>). If the requested resource requires WebID authentication the server can request the client to authenticate itself. When the Web browser encounters this certificate request, it may prompt its user to choose a certificate (from its certificate manager) \u2013 thereby signing a token with its private key \u2013 to let the client send it to the server. The verification agent extracts the public key as well as the WebID from the certificate. As the WebID enables a global dereferencing mechanism for finding a key, the server uses can decide on dereferencing the WebID Profile and verify the claims about the WebID. Once the identity verification is established, the server can look up its access control rules for the requested resource to determine if and how the request can be fulfilled. Researchers can use servers and applications implementing the WebID-TLS workflow towards securely identifying profile claims and to have access to resources may be otherwise protected.</p>

                  <p id='uri-social-agreement'>From the archiving perspective, Van de Sompel came to the conclusion that in a long enough timeline, HTTP URIs are not inherently persistent but persistable. The units of information that are registered using URIs are more of a promise made by its original or current authority. Hence, along with the examples from earlier, URI registration is ultimately a social agreement. URI owners declare a policy eg. implicit, written, verbal. If a policy is announced for a collection of URIs eg. what happens in 1000 years, then that says something about its intentions and expected level of availability. From this perspective, as discussed earlier in the <cite><a href='#registration-of-identifiers'>registration of identifiers with social contracts</a></cite>, <abbr title='Persistent Identifier'>PID</abbr>s such as DOI, PURL, w3id, and ORCID can help to prolong such promises and to extend the lifetime of accessibility of units of scholarly information.</p>

The results show that significant amount of HTTP URIs cited in STM articles are no longer responsive or adequate archived snapshots available. Authors state that it is impossible to adequately recreate the temporal context of the scholarly discourse, hence suggest that robust solutions are needed to combat the problem of reference rot. Authors can take practical steps to remedy some of these issues eg. using archives that support on-demand snapshots, embedding the archived URI with datetime information alongside the reference to the original resource \u2013 I discuss this further in <cite><a href='#robust-links'>Robust Links</a></cite>.</p>

They <q cite='https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167475'>find that for over 75% of references the content has drifted away from what it was when referenced.</q> The authors support the idea that in order to partly work around this issue, authors should pro-actively create snapshots of the referenced resources at Web archives, and referencing them in their scholarly literature. However, the authors also state that such robust embedding in the infrastructure of the existing authoring, reviewing, and publishing workflow is still an open challenge. To that end, applying the <cite><a href='#robust-links'>Robust Links</a></cite> approach can help. While the DOI-paradigm for scholarly units help to improve the link rot scenario when the custodians of the domains or the URLs of the scholarly resources relocate, the resources on the Web at large remain to be a problem given that their incentives towards longevity and access differ.</p>

                  <p id='persistent-domains-content-drift'>From the point of persistence of the domain name (losing ownership) as Berners-Lee describes, one kind of content drift would be if the content published at https://csarven.ca/ today may be different tomorrow if another authority gets to own csarven.ca and defines what goes there. Alternatively, it may be that the content at that location is dynamic, and could differ from one request to another. In both cases, content drift creates a situation where if the originally referenced resource is still the same. From the perspective of Web-based scholarly publications, changes to content \u2013 accidental or intentional \u2013 can impact the degree of reproducibility, replicability, comparability of research results, and maintaining a reliable scholarly record.</p>

For example, the PID paradigm has the following discovery path:</p>

                  <ol>
                    <li>PID is the resource identifier eg. <samp>10.2218/ijdc.v9i1.320</samp></li>
                    <li>HTTP-URI-PID is the resolving URI eg. <samp>https://doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v9i1.320</samp></li>
                    <li>HTTP-URI-LAND is the redirect URI (landing page) eg. <samp>http://www.ijdc.net/article/view/9.1.331</samp></li>
                    <li>HTTP-URI-LOC is the location URI of the content eg. <samp>http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/9.1.331/362/</samp></li>
                  </ol>

                  <p>Authors propose that using existing standards and practice, the essential ingredients for such a mapping is as follows. A PID has a Web equivalent HTTP-URI-PID, which is a requisite \u2013 minted by the naming authority. The HTTP-URI-PID can be content-negotiated to result in a) a human-readable representation at HTTP-URI-LAND or b) machine-readable representations with distinct HTTP-URI-MACH. The HTTP-URI-LAND remains the same for discovery, however, HTTP-URI-MACH uses an RDF-based approach to describe the aggregations of scholarly assets based on the OAI-ORE specification.</p>

                  <p id='pid-uri-ownership'>It is worth briefly revisiting the notion of social agreements around Web resources. Conceptually, the agreement that I make with you about the persistence of my website\u2019s resources is in essence the same as a naming authority controlling a PID, as well as all of the nodes in between HTTP-URI-LOC. The kind of mapping between a domain name and the IP address it points to is similar to a PID being mapped to a HTTP-URI-PID. Hence, <em>URI Ownership</em> essentially involves two possibilities: either I \u201cown\u201d and control a URI space or someone else does.</p>

In order to preserve the context of linked resources at the time of linking, a <em>link robustness</em> strategy is applied by way of creating a snapshot of the original resource and making it available to data consumers. The <cite>Link Decoration</cite> approach decorates links in hypertext documents in order to be human- and machine-actionable. By additionally associating the datetime information when linking helps to retain such context. The datetime information can be accompanied with a snapshot of the target URI made at a Web archive or a versioning system when linking, and using either the original or the versioned resource as the primary reference. Including datetime information in the source document can make it possible to interpret the context of each of the links in the document and to discover relevant snapshots. In the event that a linked resource or a snapshot becomes inaccessible, the datetime information helps to discover temporally close alternative snapshots.</p>

This is useful to determine if the content is corrupted or manipulated. It follows that trusty URI artifacts are immutable as each version of a content generates a unique trusty URI. Trusty URI artifacts are considered to be permanent in that once archived or cached, the artifact can still be verified even if the original location is no longer available. Applications can use trusty URI to encode their own references, as well as compute an artifacts\u2019 trusty URI and verify before using it.

As per the client\u2013server model, their arrangement generally falls in the spectrum of tightly or loosely coupled architectures. In these systems, actors control client applications typically through user-agents. The degree of coupling that is exerted on the system varies depending on the class of components involved. More specifically, <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='http://www2009.eprints.org/92/1/p911.pdf' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190529163945/http://www2009.eprints.org/92/1/p911.pdf' data-versiondate='2019-05-29T16:39:45Z'>Why is the Web Loosely Coupled?

                  <p id='webid-loose-coupling'>Loose coupling reduces the number of assumptions each party makes about the other when exchanging information. For instance, AWWW includes various protocols for interaction, URIs to identify, and standard data formats to communicate the content. The Linked Data design principles then sets further constraints within this framework by favouring HTTP URIs, and the RDF language. A Linked Data driven system using uniform interaction and information exchange can be viewed to be more tightly coupled in comparison to an arbitrary system that is less specified or unspecified. Corollary, the loosely coupled systems set a higher requirement for using Web specifications emerging through open consensus as well as being widely deployed in order for the ecosystem to function. Otherwise, it would be impossible to communicate if there is no higher-order agreement. The loose coupling of interoperable systems based on open standards however can go beyond the arrangement of clients and servers. For instance, the notion of WebID enables loose coupling of identity, identification, authentication, authorization, and storage.</p>

In contrast to third-party controlled centralised systems, decentralised systems can have persistent availability (globally), resistance to external censorship, monopoly disruption, increased interest in privacy and security, and enable free expression with respect to information structure and semantics. In order for decentralised datastores to be effective, both servers and client application have an increased requirement on implementing consensus-based open standards in order to cultivate an interoperable ecosystem.</p>

While the hosting has usage limits, it is considered to be economical and have reliability features put in place by the host\u2019s system administrators. Any website with its own domain name can act as an independent node in a decentralised system. However, given that multiple websites reside on the same server, system-wide configuration changes or disruptions on the network usually effects all of the websites. Moreover, there are privacy and security concerns if the information on or transferring through individual dataspaces are not encrypted. Hence, the user places their trust on the hosting service\u2019s administrators.</p>

A generic PDS can be virtually realised with any HTTP server with varying configurations and capabilities offering client-side applications to communicate through open protocols and data formats. Web resources that are only intended for public read entails that the custodian allows resources to be available in response to client requests. Servers would need to factor in an authentication mechanism and authorization rules to determine who to serve the resources to and under which access constraints. A client-server interaction based on a read-write Linked Data architecture has affordances for distributed and semantically interconnected Web resources.</p>

An individual responsible for a PDS entails that they are responsible as well as accountable of its operation, abilities, policies and practice decisions on data, persistence strategies and so forth. PDS makes it possible for actors to safeguard their data by setting authentication and authorization rules for any or class of agents, being able to act as the source of truth for WebIDs and the descriptions in the profiles. Running a PDS fundamentally requires the system to fulfill the registration function for the content it makes available. As archiving is an external function, we expect other services to meet that requirement. The certification function can be fulfilled in a similar manner to registration in that the actors that are involved in the quality-control process can register their own units of information in their PDS in response to target units.</p>

                    <dd>The nodes in the system are the Web resources on servers that make up information such as profiles, articles, annotations and notifications, as well archived snapshots. The advantage of this infrastructure is that once a resource is registered (named and stored), they do not require users for its availability or functionality \u2013 a reduced attack surface. Users retain their privacy in that, access and use of resources are encapsulated, and such information about identity or actions taken is not required to spread to the rest of the network. In the case of compound resources including information from distributed resources, like with transclusions, or applications dynamically fetching information from different context, nodes may get to be aware of cross-origin requests. The <em>network topology</em> is by default <em>point-to-point</em>, ie. connections between two endpoints. However, in the case of federated servers, information can be routed and disseminated to the whole network, for example, an actor sends out a notification about their activity. The <em>authority topology</em> is that nodes (client-server or server-server) <em>interact directly</em> with each other, without necessarily requiring third-party nodes to participate. In order to establish trust, a certain amount of transparency can be used to make an authority <em>accountable</em>. In federated designs, users place their trust on their provider nodes who act as authorities on their behalf with other providers (server-server).</dd>

                    <dd>There is no single point of failure, has high availability, system performance, and generally <em>survivable</em>. However, the system\u2019s usefulness may degrade if certain resources in the network disappear or become inaccessible. For example, if a notification about an annotation is no longer available, then the annotation may need to be discovered through other routes. There is a flexible trust model in that, there is <em>no natural central authority</em>. Multiple independent authorities exist, and each verify claims based on their own (or shared) decisions eg. self-signed certificates as part of web of trust, or in the case of <em>anyone can say anything about anything</em>, consumers of such information verify the statements based on their needs. There is a <em>distributed allocation of resources assists ease of deployment</em>, and independent extensibility. As with the open-world assumption, nodes are not expected to have complete knowledge, and conflicting knowledge can enter the system. Decentralised systems while benefit from network <em>location diversity</em>, they may also be subject to censored both on the network and legal levels. The <em>development and operation is decoupled</em> in that open software can be publicly visible and auditable before being used by authorities. Original resources as well as versioned or archived copies can have <em>publicly verifiable integrity</em>. Decentralised system are relatively secure in that compromising or weakening the system requires attackers to engage with different services, or code bases. <em>Public accountability</em> can be devised to detect and exclude misinformation, as well as misbehaving or compromised actors. A decentralised system can incorporate trusted centralised nodes eg. community agreed scholarly reviews, archives, caching servers, proxies, and so forth, while if compromised by adversaries or disappearance is temporarily kept local \u2013 possibly a performance or discovery problem.</dd>

                    <dd>Due to the way resources are distributed in decentralised systems, they offer greater user data privacy with respect to their communication, identities, and actions than centralised systems in that there is no single authority that can observe all data and interactions. In essence, it makes it challenging for an adversary to aggregate and connect all information in a way that can undeniably hold a participant in the system accountable. These systems can allow different degrees of confidential participation in that agents (human or machine) can remain anonymous or use their pseudonymous identities. For instance, sensitive research data can be kept confidential. Access controlled resources can be accessible by trusted parties. Actions of an actor can potentially be unlinkable and so rendering a global search of information useless. The communication between parties can be undetectable and unobservable by unauthorised third-parties.</dd>

                    <dt id='what-are-the-disadvantages-of-decentralizing'>What are the disadvantages of decentralizing?</dt>
                    <dd>Decentralised systems inherently increases the number of attack vectors that an adversary can use due to number of software implementations and configurations. A compromised node in the network can potentially monitor activities, corrupt information exchange, insert malicious code, distribute data to interested parties while undetected, reduce or expose anonymity, provide inconsistent views, and so forth. As there is no single authority to globally manage the nodes in the network, the quality and availability of the services will vary and becomes challenging for each node to actively and effectively protect themselves. For example, an article, its inbox, and the annotations referred from each notification may all reside at different network locations, and thus data consumers would need to factor in potential issues arising from each node by defending themselves or routing around disturbances. Decentralisation also poses an obstacle for accountability and reputation in that while actors may control a node, handling the ramifications of a misbehaved node becomes difficult in the broader ecosystem. Finding, discovering, and interactions on fine-grained resources are typically less efficient than centralised systems.</dd>

                    <dt id='what-implicit-centralized-assumptions-remain'>What implicit centralized assumptions remain?</dt>
                    <dd>Decentralised systems include social and technical aspects of centralisations. The DNS is the most prominent example of centralisation in that domain names are administered by an entity other than the actors interacting in the information space. The name which resolves to a node is generally governed by a single authority solely determining the level of privacy the node offers as well as its availability. For instance, since registration of units of communication are mere records of content, their persistence and preservation are at the discretion of the owners of the URI space. Thus, archiving by trusted parties is necessary to take into account \u2013 which essentially introduces additional centralised entities. The use of certain certification authorities also introduces hierarchically structured centralised governance into the system, hence fundamentally allowing single entities to revoke authenticate credentials, or eventually influencing abuse-prevention, reputation, and trust. Along these lines, carrying out access policy management and enforcement by independent nodes introduces central locations for potential attacks. Web standards are a form of social centralisation in that they reflect the participants\u2019 norms and agenda. Similarly, content delivery networks, for wide reuse introduces a single point of failure for large number of services \u2013 a potential risk even for open-source software.</dd>

                  <p>On one end of the spectrum, an actor eg. an individual, registers their own domain name, hosts their personal storage, and uses applications of their choosing. With that, they have highest degree of autonomy. On the other end of the spectrum, an individual\u2019s identifier as well as a range of expressible identities, the data location and conditions of use, and assigned applications by third-party services.</p>

                  <p>I focus on interactions based on the <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190729124643/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model' data-versiondate='2019-07-29T12:46:43Z'>client\u2013server model</a></cite> under the <cite><a href='#architecture-of-the-web'>Architecture of the Web</a></cite>, identifiers and data are conceptually decoupled components. In the case of identifiers, I focus mainly on HTTP-based URIs, and the social conventions around <cite><a href='#uri-ownership'>URI Ownership</a></cite>. Finally, the applications comprise software that actors can use.</p>

                  <p>While centralisation of data and applications are two distinct areas of concern, some of the challenges we face in scholarly communication make them appear as one. When we discuss challenges around access to knowledge, the location and quality of the data is often conflated with the tools or services which are required to access the data. Being required to use particular software to create, format or share research articles, to create accounts on particular services, or agree to certain terms and conditions impose a set of characteristics on research output or data itself.</p>

                  <p>Data and application appear to be intertwined because the workflows that the researchers are required to use tend to be unique and proprietary and predominantly enforced by third-parties. While some of the differences in designs may be due to historical reasons they also ensure various forms of vendor lock-in on both the research outputs and the applications to generate, share and reuse data. The use of non-interoperable (or even post-facto) methods to create and exchange data on the Web leads to the fragmentation of data through silo-services, and along with it the dependency on applications having their interaction mechanisms established via out-of-band knowledge. By strictly focusing on the current quality of machine-readable scholarly information on the Web, the technical obstacles are evident and ample. The applications need to be continuously hard-wired to know where and what to look for; what to do once something of interest is found; or where to go next in the discovery phase. Similarly, automating discovery of fine-grained information without human interference is still central to the limitations.</p>

                  <p>Different degrees of control would influence the forces and functions in scholarly communication. For instance, while ORCID is community controlled, it is possible for individuals to customise their profiles and to link to their other identities. The profile description can indicate the location of researcher\u2019s personal online storage, inbox, as well as outbox, which can be controlled by the individual. The DOI system on the other hand is governed by an organisation where the mapping between an identifier and the location of content they refer to is managed by select few organisations (as opposed to individuals).</p>

                    <li>Self-hosted and individually-controlled personal identifiers denoted with HTTP URIs</li>

                <h3 property='schema:name'>The Effects and Artifacts of Autonomous Engagement</h3>
                <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                  <p>The Web\u2019s design stands out because of its absence of centralised control, both for technical reasons of scalability and resilience as well as a societal need to exercise creative and effective communication. A challenge in such large-scale decentralised networks is how related publications can be semantically interlinked, even if they are authored and published by different parties. Centralising their publications is practiced by the majority of authoring networks today, demanding authors to give up some or all of their control in exchange for technical simplicity.</p>

                  <p>We can approach an alternative to this centralisation by adopting Web-centric workflows that are inherently interoperable by design, but most importantly by enabling the creators and the users of data and applications to be autonomous entities, working towards the democratisation of scholarly knowledge for humans and machines. One way to achieve this is by decentralisation and decoupling of data and applications. By <dfn typeof='skos:Concept' resource='#concept-scheme' rel='skos:topConceptOf' property='skos:prefLabel' id='concept-decentralisation' about='#concept-decentralisation'>decentralisation</dfn>, I mean <span property='skos:definition' about='#concept-decentralisation'>data and applications are loosely coupled, and users can choose where their data is stored. I focus on Web-based decentralisation, where content is transported over HTTP, and resources are identified with URIs.</span></p>

                  <p>The future of self-registration of scholarly units depends in large part on how well its practitioners, advocates, educators alike, are able to reconcile the ideals that the medium offers with the realities of the commercial third-party systems within which scholarly communication operates and the homogenizing influences of scholarly socialisation.</p>

                  <p>While these challenges are technically surmountable, they need to be taken seriously if, the extreme case where <em>anyone can say anything about anything</em> is subject to be treated on equal grounds as a piece of information that is well certified. One contemporary and popular example of this scenario is where nearly all scientists being in agreement on the presence of global warming, climate change, and its consequences. In order to honour a commitment to public service, scientific communication \u2013 independent to self-registration \u2013 must remain grounded on reproducible and replicable facts and explanations, as well as pertain attributable and accountable participants. The output affects society, from journalism, advancement of scientific knowledge, policy making, as well public opinion and perception.</p>

                  <p>Decentralised authoring, publication, and annotation furthermore have the potential to impact areas in which centralised services currently determine the pace of evolution. Scientific publishing, for instance, is often bound to centralised review and dissemination processes. Instead, rigorous scientific discourse can still be realised with an open, decentralised environment for the annotation of manuscripts, which can potentially reach interested parties in a timely manner. Trust then no longer stems from a finite process with limited transparency, but is rather continuously assessed by repeated independent validation. Publication thereby becomes the starting point rather than the end point of the scholarly communication process. An application built with interoperable open Web standards can potentially communicate with services that conform to the same protocols and data models.</p>

                  <p id='non-functional-requirements'><strong>Non-Functional Requirements</strong>: While there are plethora of <cite>architecturally significant requirements</cite> such as institutional or orientations in society and industry, I focus on non-functional and functional requirements which enable personal and academic freedom, in particular to creating affordances towards autonomy and interoperable participation on the open Web. I derive non-functional requirements for systems to aim at addressing the forces and functions in scientific communication through the following:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><em>Interoperability</em> to improve discovery, accessibility, integrability, and reusability.</li>
                    <li><em>Security and privacy</em> to honour desire to remain safe and information not to be shared without consent.</li>
                    <li><em>Modularity and extensibility</em> to enable evolvable and reconfigurable systems.</li>
                    <li><em>Data integrity, transparency, and reliability</em> towards building trust.</li>
                    <li><em>Persistence and preservation</em> to ensure that units of scholarly information preserves into the future.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>In order to support publishers and consumers (in the most general sense of <em>actor</em> roles), it is important to seek system designs that give control to its users at various fronts. This is to foster a scholarly ecosystem where users having the means to participate:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>by creating and using their preferred identifiers for identities and data;</li>
                    <li>by deciding what can access data and under which conditions;</li>
                    <li>by using different applications on the same data for different purposes.</li>

The declarative approach tends to be short, easy to understand, independent of implementation, less likely to contain errors as well as to easily correct, and tractable. For example, many domain-specific markup languages, such as HTML and XML-family (XSLT, SVG, MathML), and CSS are declarative. HTML simply tells the consuming agent \u2013 like a Web browser \u2013 what should appear as part of a Webpage. HTML\u2019s readability and ease of interpretation played a role in its adoption \u2013 anyone that wanted to express some information in a Webpage can "view source" to learn without any further steps."""^^rdf:HTML;

Here, Smith emphasises allowing greater academic freedom and shifting of power and control from the monolithic third-parties to the knowledge producers, which could be realised in either an <em>institution-</em> or <em>researcher-centric</em> approach. In this process, journals with the refereeing process would link to the articles with full content hosted on the authors\u2019 Web sites.

In the case of identifiers, I focus mainly on HTTP-based URIs, and the social conventions around <cite><a href='#uri-ownership'>URI Ownership</a></cite>. Finally, the applications comprise software that actors can use.</p>\n\n                  <p>While centralisation of data and applications are two distinct areas of concern, some of the challenges we face in scholarly communication make them appear as one. When we discuss challenges around access to knowledge, the location and quality of the data is often conflated with the tools or services which are required to access the data. Being required to use particular software to create, format or share research articles, to create accounts on particular services, or agree to certain terms and conditions impose a set of characteristics on research output or data itself.</p>\n\n                  <p>Data and application appear to be intertwined because the workflows that the researchers are required to use tend to be unique and proprietary and predominantly enforced by third-parties. While some of the differences in designs may be due to historical reasons they also ensure various forms of vendor lock-in on both the research outputs and the applications to generate, share and reuse data. The use of non-interoperable (or even post-facto) methods to create and exchange data on the Web leads to the fragmentation of data through silo-services, and along with it the dependency on applications having their interaction mechanisms established via out-of-band knowledge. By strictly focusing on the current quality of machine-readable scholarly information on the Web, the technical obstacles are evident and ample. The applications need to be continuously hard-wired to know where and what to look for; what to do once something of interest is found; or where to go next in the discovery phase. Similarly, automating discovery of fine-grained information without human interference is still central to the limitations.</p>\n\n                  <p>Different degrees of control would influence the forces and functions in scholarly communication. For instance, while ORCID is community controlled, it is possible for individuals to customise their profiles and to link to their other identities. The profile description can indicate the location of researcher\u2019s personal online storage, inbox, as well as outbox, which can be controlled by the individual.

I will take conformance to the Linked Data design principles into account, as well as Web application best practices.

Two parties are involved in the creation of a notification: a <em>sender</em>, generating the notification data, and a <em>receiver</em>, storing the created resource. We also have the role of a <em>consumer</em>, which reads the notification data made available by a receiver, and repurposes it in some way. A software implementation can of course play two or all three of these roles; the important part is that it need not. A consuming application can read and use notification data without being concerned about ever sending or storing notifications.</p>\n\n                  <p id='reusability'><strong>Reusability</strong> (<a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#reusable-notifications'>R2</a>): The relationship between the <em>consumer</em> and <em>receiver</em> roles is key to notifications being reusable. A consumer must be able to autonomously find the location of notifications for or about the particular resource it is interested in. To achieve this, we place a requirement on the receiver to expose notifications it has been sent in such away to permit consumer applications to access them; and specify how any resource can advertise its receiving endpoint for consumers to discover. To promote fair use or remixing of notification contents, applications can incorporate rights and licensing information into the data. Similarly, applications may include additional information on licensing resources that the notification refers to. The presence of this type of information is important for consumers to assess the (re)usability of data.</p>\n\n                  <p id='persistence-and-retrievability'><strong>Persistence and Retrievability</strong> (<a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#persistence-and-retrievability'>R3</a>): Given the traditionally ephemeral nature of notifications, here we refer to persistence as units of information that can be registered. Applications may benefit from referring to or reusing notifications if the notifications are known to be retrievable in the long term, or indicate their expected lifespan. This enforces the notion that notifications are considered resources in their own right, with their own dereferencable URIs.</p>\n\n                  <p id='adaptability'><strong>Adaptability</strong> (<a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#adaptability'>R4</a>): A notification protocol should be adaptable for different domains, but that there is no need to create multiple domain-specific notification protocols; the fundamental mechanics are the same given the three main architectural layers of the Web \u2013 identification, interaction, data formats.</p>\n\n                  <p id='target-representation'><strong>Target representation</strong> (<a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#target-representation'>R4-A</a>): Any resource may be the <em>target</em> of a notification. By target, we mean a notification may be addressed <em>to</em> the resource, be <em>about</em> the resource, or for a sender to otherwise decide that it is appropriate to draw the attention of the resource (or resource owner) to the information in the notification body. As such, any Web resource must be able to advertise an endpoint to which it can receive notifications. Resources can be RDF or non-RDF (such as an image, or CSV dataset), and may be informational (a blog post, a user profile) or non-informational (a person).</p>\n\n                  <p id='notification-body'><strong>Notification body</strong> (<a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#notification-body'>R4-B</a>): We consider the <em>contents</em> of a notification to be application specific because different domains have different needs. From a sender\u2019s perspective, we permit a notification to contain <em>any data</em>, and a notification can use <em>any vocabulary</em>.

        "\n                  <p>I use the same set of questions raised in <cite>Systematizing Decentralization and Privacy</cite> to study the design choices for an actor-controlled system based in context of the <cite><a href='#architecture-of-the-web'>Architecture of the Web</a></cite>:</p>\n\n                  <dl>\n                    <dt id='how-is-the-system-decentralized'>How is the system decentralized?</dt>\n                    <dd>The nodes in the system are the Web resources on servers that make up information such as profiles, articles, annotations and notifications, as well archived snapshots. The advantage of this infrastructure is that once a resource is registered (named and stored), they do not require users for its availability or functionality \u2013 a reduced attack surface. Users retain their privacy in that, access and use of resources are encapsulated, and such information about identity or actions taken is not required to spread to the rest of the network. In the case of compound resources including information from distributed resources, like with transclusions, or applications dynamically fetching information from different context, nodes may get to be aware of cross-origin requests. The <em>network topology</em> is by default <em>point-to-point</em>, ie. connections between two endpoints. However, in the case of federated servers, information can be routed and disseminated to the whole network, for example, an actor sends out a notification about their activity. The <em>authority topology</em> is that nodes (client-server or server-server) <em>interact directly</em> with each other, without necessarily requiring third-party nodes to participate. In order to establish trust, a certain amount of transparency can be used to make an authority <em>accountable</em>. In federated designs, users place their trust on their provider nodes who act as authorities on their behalf with other providers (server-server).</dd>\n\n                    <dt id='what-advantages-do-we-get-from-decentralizing'>What advantages do we get from decentralizing?</dt>\n                    <dd>There is no single point of failure, has high availability, system performance, and generally <em>survivable</em>. However, the system\u2019s usefulness may degrade if certain resources in the network disappear or become inaccessible. For example, if a notification about an annotation is no longer available, then the annotation may need to be discovered through other routes. There is a flexible trust model in that, there is <em>no natural central authority</em>. Multiple independent authorities exist, and each verify claims based on their own (or shared) decisions eg. self-signed certificates as part of web of trust, or in the case of <em>anyone can say anything about anything</em>, consumers of such information verify the statements based on their needs. There is a <em>distributed allocation of resources assists ease of deployment</em>, and independent extensibility. As with the open-world assumption, nodes are not expected to have complete knowledge, and conflicting knowledge can enter the system. Decentralised systems while benefit from network <em>location diversity</em>, they may also be subject to censored both on the network and legal levels. The <em>development and operation is decoupled</em> in that open software can be publicly visible and auditable before being used by authorities. Original resources as well as versioned or archived copies can have <em>publicly verifiable integrity</em>. Decentralised system are relatively secure in that compromising or weakening the system requires attackers to engage with different services, or code bases. <em>Public accountability</em> can be devised to detect and exclude misinformation, as well as misbehaving or compromised actors. A decentralised system can incorporate trusted centralised nodes eg. community agreed scholarly reviews, archives, caching servers, proxies, and so forth, while if compromised by adversaries or disappearance is temporarily kept local \u2013 possibly a performance or discovery problem.</dd>\n\n                    <dt id='how-does-decentralization-support-privacy'>How does decentralization support privacy?</dt>\n                    <dd>Due to the way resources are distributed in decentralised systems, they offer greater user data privacy with respect to their communication, identities, and actions than centralised systems in that there is no single authority that can observe all data and interactions. In essence, it makes it challenging for an adversary to aggregate and connect all information in a way that can undeniably hold a participant in the system accountable. These systems can allow different degrees of confidential participation in that agents (human or machine) can remain anonymous or use their pseudonymous identities. For instance, sensitive research data can be kept confidential. Access controlled resources can be accessible by trusted parties. Actions of an actor can potentially be unlinkable and so rendering a global search of information useless. The communication between parties can be undetectable and unobservable by unauthorised third-parties.</dd>\n\n                    <dt id='what-are-the-disadvantages-of-decentralizing'>What are the disadvantages of decentralizing?</dt>\n                    <dd>Decentralised systems inherently increases the number of attack vectors that an adversary can use due to number of software implementations and configurations. A compromised node in the network can potentially monitor activities, corrupt information exchange, insert malicious code, distribute data to interested parties while undetected, reduce or expose anonymity, provide inconsistent views, and so forth. As there is no single authority to globally manage the nodes in the network, the quality and availability of the services will vary and becomes challenging for each node to actively and effectively protect themselves. For example, an article, its inbox, and the annotations referred from each notification may all reside at different network locations, and thus data consumers would need to factor in potential issues arising from each node by defending themselves or routing around disturbances. Decentralisation also poses an obstacle for accountability and reputation in that while actors may control a node, handling the ramifications of a misbehaved node becomes difficult in the broader ecosystem. Finding, discovering, and interactions on fine-grained resources are typically less efficient than centralised systems.</dd>\n\n                    <dt id='what-implicit-centralized-assumptions-remain'>What implicit centralized assumptions remain?</dt>\n                    <dd>Decentralised systems include social and technical aspects of centralisations. The DNS is the most prominent example of centralisation in that domain names are administered by an entity other than the actors interacting in the information space. The name which resolves to a node is generally governed by a single authority solely determining the level of privacy the node offers as well as its availability. For instance, since registration of units of communication are mere records of content, their persistence and preservation are at the discretion of the owners of the URI space. Thus, archiving by trusted parties is necessary to take into account \u2013 which essentially introduces additional centralised entities. The use of certain certification authorities also introduces hierarchically structured centralised governance into the system, hence fundamentally allowing single entities to revoke authenticate credentials, or eventually influencing abuse-prevention, reputation, and trust. Along these lines, carrying out access policy management and enforcement by independent nodes introduces central locations for potential attacks. Web standards are a form of social centralisation in that they reflect the participants\u2019 norms and agenda. Similarly, content delivery networks, for wide reuse introduces a single point of failure for large number of services \u2013 a potential risk even for open-source software.</dd>\n                  </dl>\n                "^^rdf:HTML;

                      <p>Today it would be difficult to think of a Web without social functions. Perhaps the Web\u2019s support and ability to facilitate social interactions \u2013 above anything else \u2013 contributed to the transformation of societies in the last quarter century. The Web, as a medium, expedited all patterns of social interrelationships in a manner that can be more efficiently documented, discovered and reused. It necessitates that system designs should be inclusive and facilitate <em>involvement</em> within the range of an actor\u2019s autonomy. Furthermore, actors should be able to use socially-aware decentralised applications that can perform the core functions in scholarly communications \u2013 registration, awareness, certification, and archiving.</p>

                      <p>The systems that are designed to fulfill the functions in scholarly communication should operate with the expectation of autonomous participation. One value that can be upheld through the principle of autonomy is to not have any constraints on where units of communication can exist on the Web. For instance, the actors of a system can have the freedom to designate identifiers to their artifacts: profile(s), articles, annotations, notifications, data, and so forth, as well as where they can be retrieved from. Similarly, the actor\u2019s autonomy to use preferred applications to interact with data. The <em>decentralisation</em> of the information space is <em>a</em> means to gain autonomy on the Web. With respect to <em>delocalisation</em>, units of information, eg. personal Web identifiers (WebID) controlled by their owners, can be used across different systems as they need not be tied to any particular URI space or system, and are free from external influences. Ultimately, autonomy is the right to freely choose and maintain sovereignty over URI ownership and data spaces, and the ability to use or switch between applications that can interact with them. Likewise, actors\u2019 autonomy would not obstruct them to use shared URI spaces if they so desire.</p>

                      <p>Any type of object, eg. scientific literature, research objects, personal websites, profiles and social graphs, can be made available on the Web provided that the <em>actors</em> have sufficient control over their URIs, or delegate to entities they trust. Through URI ownership, deconstructing and decoupling of resources can take place.</p>

                      <p>The contents of HTTP URLs may be logically centralised or decentralised. For example, the media representations found at the URL can embed compound or dynamic components that are dependent on external (remote) URLs. In this particular case, the persistence of the external URLs, as well as whether their contents are immutable is a design concern.</p>

                      <p>Autonomy is an important ingredient to fully exercise <em>freedom of expression</em>, which is a civil liberty. If a URI is governed by a third-party entity, ie. other than the researcher who shares the contents of a scientific resource, then it is possible that the URLs may no longer resolve, and the content may be subject to change in ways beyond researcher\u2019s control. Whereas without intermediaries, the researcher has sufficient access and control as to what happens at their URI space. This gives actors the ability to exercise <em>self-registration</em> with respect to the registration function. Trust in this case may be placed on the Web space that is closer to the owner and publisher of the URI.</p>

                      <p>The right to have <em>freedom of expression</em> necessitates that the articulation of scholarly contributions are not subject to arbitrary interference from third-parties, and allow actors to seek the most appropriate ways to co-create and co-participate. We inherit:</p>

                      <p id='freedom-of-expression-constraints'>Freedom of expression in context of academic communication does not entail that any arbitrary artifact eg. self-published articles, passes quality-control and certification from the community, or ethically appropriate. By free expression, I mean that actors should not be subject to <em>technical constraints</em> on how they communicate their discoveries and knowledge with the rest of the world. That is, to have the means to <em>shape</em> machine-readable structure and semantics, presentations, and interactions. Enrolling in the certification process of some literature can for instance mean that reviewers may engage in any aspect and granularity of the contribution itself, eg. a weakness for an argument in one literature can be contrasted (and linked) with a scientific result presented in another literature. Academic freedom to express entails that researchers caring out their work comply with discipline-specific methods and meet standards related to accuracy, precision, completeness, reliability, relevance, and so forth. Furthermore, as with human rights, the ability to express does not grant unethical practices at the expense of any person or group. Technical expressions that are harmful or discriminatory, eg. inaccessible content, constrained presentations, or undesirable user interactions, should be avoided.</p>

                      <p>The concerns about authenticity, persistence and permanence of data and knowledge is constant regardless of where the resources reside on the Web. Hence, strictly trusting scholarly knowledge based on its registered location is ultimately fragile in that it is unavoidable to prevent all sorts of threats to preservation in a long enough timeline. However, since the registration function is decoupled from archiving, we are able to delegate that trust to a third-party that is best fit to handle the preservation and to some extent guarantee the authenticity of the units of communication. This is particularly important as archival and trust are part of the global scholarly commons.</p>

                      <p>In context of the Web, technical or social decentralisation at all levels is unattainable. Even open Web standards are based on social and technical decisions, and can be seen as a form of centralisation in that conforming systems cluster and coordinate among themselves. Similarly, centralisation naturally occurs in social systems like concepts or language, eg. machine-readable vocabularies restrict the set of uses of a system. The alternative pushed to the extreme where each unit is expressed in their own language and without any language mapping, puts us in a situation similar to that of the <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212311/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:11Z'>Tower of Babel</a></cite>, ie. being incapable of understanding each other. Hence, autonomy in a system where researchers are isolated or information is not interpretable renders freedom of expression meaningless.</p>

                      <p>The <abbr title='Architecture of the World Wide Web'>AWWW</abbr> states that agents, <em>interpret</em> available <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#dereference-details'>representation according to the data format specification that corresponds to the representation\u2019s Internet Media Type.</q> Here we can use the term <em>interpretation</em> in the general sense for both human and machine consumers of representations. An interpretation entails that a given content can be identified or discovered; comprehended in context of where and how it is used; as well being to put it to further use. Scientific and scholarly knowledge representations using information models that are based on Web standards brought through open consensus benefit from wide reuse.</p>

                      <p id='interoperability'><strong>Interoperability</strong>: In order to achieve cooperative systems, interoperable mechanisms are essential. One widely successful approach to have interoperable systems is through the adoption of open standards for protocols and languages that are arrived through open consensus. As per Linked Data design principles, this is accomplished with HTTP for communication, URI for identification, and RDF as language. While a decentralised system can enable each entity to be autonomous, some level of agreement is needed on the network for communication to take place. Systems that are interoperable by design have the benefit of interacting with other systems without having prior or out-of-band knowledge about them. This kind of interoperability can be contrasted with <em>post-facto</em> interoperability that is typically due to propriety designs at the discretion of each party, and then bridging the systems with application adapters and semantic mappings. In such cases, given two systems, one system adopts the others\u2019 protocol, API, or format, or they build specialised mechanisms in order to communicate. Systems that do not use open standards or have specialised technological extensions that are only useful within their own environment are generally considered to be vendor lock-in solutions. Here we seek agreements on Web standards established through open consensus, as opposed to independent and individual design choices made in application implementations.</p>

                      <p>Systems vary on their level of interoperability. For instance, a service may require their own user account or authentication mechanism to be used when interacting with data on the Web; users may have to use a particular application to access, create, share or reuse information; applications may need to be reconfigured to reuse the information that is created elsewhere. In the <cite><a href='#acid-test'>Acid Test</a></cite> section I propose criteria to self-assess accessibility and interoperability of artifacts in scholarly communication.</p>

                      <p>There is a balance between free expression of structure and semantics (through autonomy) and the degree of a communication (interoperability) that different parties can achieve. At the same time, as concentration or centralisation of ideas is ultimately inescapable, interoperability influences or limits the choices a system can take. Hence, we embrace the notion of interoperability as a trade-off, ie. it is better to seek and adapt design patterns that are expected or intended to be useful for the ecosystem. Hence, interoperability is a social construct with the intention of balancing autonomy and cooperative systems.</p>

                      <p>In order to have optimal means of discovery, exchanging, and reusing information, systems and data should opt for open standards and widely acknowledged best practices wherever possible. Linked Data technologies include some of the essentials to achieve this, and are well-suited to fulfill the four functions of scholarly communication on the Web.</p>

                      <p>Thus we refer to <q>universal access</q> in the widest sense that any agent; human, machine, or other can effectively access information and participate in interacting with different systems.</p>

                  <p>In recent decades there has been a global shift in communication forms used for scientific activities. This perhaps demonstrates a desire for amplification of the senses that are used to consume and create knowledge. For instance, print-centric emphasises the linearity of scientific information representation and its communication, whereas a Web-centric approach makes multimodal interactions possible within the same domain. Scientists need no longer fit their understanding of the world within the confines of static and two-dimensional descriptions of phenomena. The need to travel great distances for first-hand observations and collaboration is also reduced. With electronic media, and more specifically the Web, we have the option to also watch, listen, and participate around measured observations, instantaneously as the events occur, or after the fact around persistent and detailed logs. Just as the invention of the printing press transformed the codification and mobility of knowledge, the Web transformed and extended human and machine communication on all fronts. What will be further explored in this thesis is the extent to which our current scholarly activities make use of the inherent qualities of the Web, as well as ways to further take advantage of these qualities.</p>

        "\n                      <p>dokieli shows that it is possible for people to interact with each other without central coordination. Users can choose storage space for their content independently of the applications with which they edit and view that content. Documents are connected statically through links and dynamically through Linked Data Notifications. This is a proof for the viability of a social and decentralised authoring and annotation environment based on Web standards. dokieli happens to be one application that demonstrates the potentials of decentralised notifications and annotations. The information it creates does not result in a vendor lock-in, as other applications are able to reuse them \u2013 given agreement on using open Web standards.</p>\n\n                      <p>On the other hand, dokieli\u2019s use of standards shows that dokieli itself is only one means to an end: once the document has been created, it lives on independently. The <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_machine' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105639/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_machine' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:39Z'>social machine</a></cite> consists of people and documents, connected by Web standards, with dokieli acting as just one possible catalyst. Different Web applications can incorporate any of dokieli\u2019s functions and implement the principles to varying extent. Since the data is decoupled from the application, we avoid the <em>walled garden</em> problem of current social platforms today, as well as various forms of vendor lock-in with some applications, even if they are are operating in a loosely coupled environment. In essence, it is possible to swap dokieli with another client application and still communicate with any standards-compliant server. This is one of the key steps to liberating actors to create and share without setting burdens on URI, data and application control.</p>\n\n                      <p>A couple of important sociotechnical challenges remain, and implications on autonomy. Resources might want to indicate in a granular way which actions they support or encourage, such as assessments, bookmarking, or sharing, and perhaps conditions about which notifications should be sent when any of these events take place. In order to encourage positive behaviour, we might want ways to provide moderation, and solutions to prevent harassment and abuse. Closely related is the issue of identity, pseudonymity and anonymity, and its relation with trust and verification. There are also social implications of dokieli\u2019s Web browser extension and social graph. For instance, the ability of annotating and sharing information even if the primary article does not have an inbox or an annotation service. There is no administrator that oversees everything, but that each actor has control privileges to what they are given. Having the ability to annotate anything and stored at a preferred location enables actor autonomy. This can be contrasted with annotation systems that may restrict annotations from getting created with particular targets or annotations having particular information in its body.</p>\n                    "^^rdf:HTML;

It can be used by publishers and archives to interchange scholarly content in a uniform way. The intent of its Tag Suite is to prescribe and to preserve the structure and semantics of the original content independent of the presentation. JATS includes three Tag Sets: journal archive and interchange, journal publishing, and article authoring. In the case of peer reviewed scholarly articles that are intended to be archived, the publication may also include information about the conference the research was presented at, data about the publication and journal, document history, license, funding, and various kinds of annotations.

RASH aims at sharing scholarly documents through the Web while working within the existing publishing workflow, and is expected to be produced from MS Word, ODT and LaTeX sources. RASH has been developed as a formal grammar using RelaxNG which includes a subset of elements \u2013 32 \u2013 from HTML5. With the exception of the <code>script</code> element, it is compiled of printable elements. Its grammar facilitates RASH documents to run against a markup validator, to convert between sources, rendering for Web and print media, and to extract additional semantics. Its rationale for representing human-visible and machine-readable information in HTML varies eg. title, authors, keywords of an article are used as hidden metadata, and require additional processing to make it human-visible in the Web browser, as such a dependency on JavaScript support and being enabled. The resulting grammar favours simplicity towards authoring over expressing accurate or appropriate semantics eg. <code>h1</code> for all heading levels is used, as opposed to HTML5\u2019s required heaving levels (<samp>hX</samp>).

It applies the notion of <q>semantic overlays</q> for its markup patterns with focus on role-based semantics as defined in WAI-ARIA, DPUB-ARIA, and semantic representations using RDFa. The \u2013 work-in-progress \u2013 specification explains how concepts for people and organisation, article semantics, schema roles, actions, citations, document rights, and so forth can be marked using appropriate vocabularies, using the schema.org vocabulary as base. In order to simplify authoring, where applicable, it is encouraged to use RDFa markup patterns where the depth (level of nesting in the DOM tree) for the RDF statements would be relatively flat.

Content can be the result of a combination of other registered items; data may be available through interactions, or depend on acquiring externally registered items. In order to empower scholarly communities from a systems perspective, the article posits that there should be more flexibility in what constitutes a unit of scholarly communication in order to allow registration, as well as factoring timing and the quality of what is to be registered. The article also acknowledge the presence of an additional function in the market which reflects the academic credit and policy in the current system. A derived function, <q>rewarding</q> of actors <q>for their performance in the communication system based on metrics derived from that system</q>. For rewarding to take place, the information space needs to provide the ability to extract meaningful metrics.</p>\n\n                  <p id='a-perspective-on-archiving-the-scholarly-web'>In <cite><a rel='cito:obtainsBackgroundFrom' href='https://hvdsomp.info/papers/Papers/2014/iPres2014_Sompel_Treloar.pdf' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20180822222954/https://hvdsomp.info/papers/Papers/2014/iPres2014_Sompel_Treloar.pdf' data-versiondate='2018-06-24T16:34:27Z'>A Perspective on Archiving the Scholarly Web</a></cite>, Van de Sompel, 2014 characterises the ongoing evolution and transition of objects pertaining to scholarly communication. In particular, the communication is becoming more <q>Web-centric</q> ie. visible, continuous, informal, instant, content-driven, and the communicated objects vary in their type, have compound composition, diverse, networked, and open.</p>\n\n                  <p>Given that the emergence of the Web influenced the communication market by transforming it from predominantly being medium-driven into a content-driven ecosystem, as well as the research process becoming more visible on the Web (per the <q>Open Science</q> movement), the article also posit that the aforementioned indicators impact the functions in scientific communication, and in particular have a significant impact on the future of archiving. The observation is based on the archival process held on the Web; unplanned and unconstrained archiving, organically occurring, by way of Web objects being deposited across distributed and dedicated archival services. They describe the effect of Web-based archiving with respect to the four functions:</p>\n\n                  <ul id='web-archiving-forces-functions'>\n                    <li>registration: a wide variety and versions of objects that are compound, dynamic, interrelated, and interdependent are available from different Web platforms;</li>\n                    <li>certification: a variety of mechanisms that are decoupled from registration;</li>\n                    <li>awareness: a variety of objects being communicated in real-time and social;</li>\n                    <li>archiving: <q>no constraints on the number or kinds of parties that can hold archived copies</q>, the need for <q>appropriate levels of cross-archive interoperability in order to support seamless, uniform access to archived objects</q>, that are temporally appropriate while context being preserved</li>\n                  </ul>\n\n                  <p>The authors conclude that in order to address the needs of a distributed archival approach for scholarly Web objects, standards will play a central role for interoperable systems.</p>\n\n                  <p id='rethinking-distributed-archived-scholarly-communication'>Given the dynamic nature of units of communication on the Web, vertical integration, stepping through the four functions in order (as per the traditional journal-centric ecosystem), turns out to be inadequate. Hence, an affirmation of the outlook as outlined in <cite>Rethinking Scholarly Communication</cite>, that the essential functions need to be <q cite='https://hvdsomp.info/papers/Papers/2014/iPres2014_Sompel_Treloar.pdf'>fulfilled in discreet, disaggregated, and distributed manners, and in which a variety of networked pathways interconnect the autonomous hubs that fulfill these functions</q>. The act of <q>recording</q> (or <em>registering</em> in the most general sense) a unit of communication is not a replacement for <em>archiving</em> or persistence, even if the freely available Web services are used towards this end. The authors distinguish recording and archiving in that the former is short-term, no guarantees provided, used for many read-write operations, and part of a scholarly process. Archiving serves a different function, in that it is intended for the long-term, and there is an attempt of a guarantee (or promise) and the archived artifact becomes part of the scholarly record.</p>\n\n                  <p id='web-archivable-scholarly-communication'>The authors call for another archival paradigm that is based off the characteristics of the Web. That is, given the inherently interlinked and dynamic nature of Web objects, archived resources cannot be treated as atomic resources as they do not necessarily contain the complete content. For instance, a research document on the Web may refer to external media or interactive scripts, aggregated objects, and changing or ephemeral objects. This is in contrast to the traditional journal-centric approach to archival where all material \u2013 physical paper \u2013 can be eventually tracked to library stacks. Hence, the future of archiving needs to consider the nature of the object, including the degree to which it can be archived. The complexity and care that is required for the proper preservation of digital objects is further described in <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november05/rosenthal/11rosenthal.html' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709111136/http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november05/rosenthal/11rosenthal.html' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T11:11:36Z'>Requirements for Digital Preservation Systems</a></cite>, Rosenthal, 2005, provides a taxonomy of threat models: software, communication, network, economic, organisational, to name a few, which pose a particular risk to permanent information loss. Thus, it is important to bare these potential issues in mind when considering what scholarly units of information will contain and how they will be made available.</p>\n                "^^rdf:HTML;

:formal-grammars
    schema:description
        "While HTML markup with formal grammars has the quality of being efficient for cooperating systems, it comes at the cost of wider interoperability. That is, if an application is designed to <em>only</em> work with a particular flavour or subset of HTML, then it would not be able to work with arbitrary HTML documents on the Web. Hence, having profiles or grammars in and itself not an issue, however its <em>effects</em> are likely to be that they are less interoperable than they can be. This is in contrast to applications safely ignoring information patterns they do not understand or interested in using, even if they have their preferred internal grammars or HTML templates. From the consuming side, if the application\u2019s information <em>reuse</em> is dependent on HTML a specific schema or tree structure, effectively locks the application into coping with those patterns, and ultimately less flexible about handling expressions that the application is unfamiliar with. The effect is a constrained or a closed information system."^^rdf:HTML;

        "\n                  <p>As scholarly content is created and registered, becoming globally identifiable on the Web, the next challenge is to ensure it is <em>findable</em> and <em>discoverable</em> within a decentralised system.</p>\n                  <p>I have <a href='#decentralising-scholarly-communication'>reviewed</a> a number of Web standards and specifications pertaining to <a href='#read-write-linked-data'>read-write Linked Data</a>, vocabularies about <a href='#publishing-and-referencing'>publishing resources</a> and <a href='#participation'>social participation</a>, and explained how they can be combined in various ways to realise a wide array of scholarly and social activities in a decentralised fashion. This section describes the design and standardisation of a decentralised notification system that works on the HTTP application layer.</p>\n\n                  <p>Notifications are sent over the Web for a variety of purposes, including social applications: <q>You have been invited to a vegan lunch!</q>, <q>Guinan annotated your article</q>, <q>Eunice tagged you in a photo</q>. The notification data may be displayed to a human to acknowledge, or used to trigger some other application-specific process (or both). Such notifications are also useful as part of a decentralised scholarly communications ecosystem, primarily for fulfilling the <em>awareness</em> function.</p>\n\n                  <p>Notifications are a common part of many centralised Web applications, and variety of uses are in social media. In this case, notifications are structured arbitrarily and are typically only usable by the sanctioned applications or those that generated them in the first place. So far, notifications are <em>ephemeral</em> resources which may disappear after delivery, and thus are not designed for reuse. In such systems, communication and semantic interoperability across independently built applications is not expected. This design however places limitations on possible interactions around a notification. For example, current major social media services on the Web act as disjoint closed ecosystems, commonly known as <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform'>walled gardens</a></q> in contrast to open platforms with more possibilities for extensibility and reuse of applications and content. In essence, notification data is locked into particular systems, and users are restricted to using tightly coupled applications. Such software and systems are only capable of exchanging notifications if they have prior knowledge about the actors involved, location of the data, data formats, and user interfaces. Customarily, switching applications entails switching social providers, and having to create new profiles, and yet again reconnect or build one\u2019s social network in the new system from scratch. This scenario is analogous to using an email application that\u2019s customised to each service provider, and only being able to send and receive emails from people that use the same provider. In order for information to flow between systems customised communication interfaces or APIs need to be created after the fact, thus imposing additional maintenance tax for systems to cooperate.</p>\n\n                  <p>In a decentralised architecture, notifications can be a key element for federation of information, and application integration. Current efforts towards <em>re-decentralising</em> the Web are moving towards architectures in which data storage is decoupled from application logic, freeing end users to switch between applications, or to let multiple applications operate over the same data.</p>\n\n                  <p>Similarly for a decentralised scholarly Web, notification data should not be locked into particular systems. Data generated from independently built applications should be discoverable and increase their chance for reusability by other applications. Users can choose where to store their notifications as well as using their preferred applications to create, discover, and consume the data.</p>\n\n                  <p>This section addresses the following <a href='#research-questions'>research question</a> for this thesis:</p>\n\n                  <blockquote cite='#technical-research-problems-mechanisms'>\n                    <p>What technical mechanisms, standards or protocols can be employed for decentralised information exchange on the Web?</p>\n\n                    <footer><cite><a rel='cito:includesQuotationFrom' href='#technical-research-problems-mechanisms'>Mechanisms</a></cite></footer>\n                  </blockquote>\n\n                  <p>The following are core requirements of a notifications protocol in context of <cite><a href='#degree-of-control'>Degree of Control</a></cite>:</p>\n\n                  <ul>\n                    <li>Actors can use their preferred applications to discover, reuse, and send notifications.</li>\n                    <li>Actors store incoming notifications where they prefer.</li>\n                    <li>Actors switching between applications without having to move their data.</li>\n                    <li>Actors change the location of their data without having to change their application.</li>\n                  </ul>\n\n                  <p>In the following subsections I review existing decentralised protocols for notifications, and then outline use cases for notifications in scholarly communication. These use cases yield key design considerations, which are taken into account for the design of a new protocol \u2013 Linked Data Notifications (LDN) \u2013 which can be implemented to meet the awareness function for scholarly communication in decentralised systems, as well as meet the degree of control requirements listed above. LDN also supports systems with respect to the registration, certification and archiving functions.</p>\n\n                  <p>I developed LDN and served as the specification editor as part of the W3C Social Web Working Group (<abbr title='Social Web Working Group'>SWWG</abbr>), and LDN became a W3C Recommendation in May 2017. This section outlines key features and discusses design decisions made in the context of scholarly communication; for reference the specification in its entirety can be found at <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/'>https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/</a>.</p>\n                "^^rdf:HTML;

                  <p>dokieli is a general-purpose clientside editor for decentralised article publishing, annotations and social interactions. While it implements use cases specific to research or scholarly communication, it is not constrained to any knowledge domain or field of work. For instance, dokieli is capable of rendering the following use cases from the W3C <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709111137/https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T11:11:37Z'>RDFa Use Cases: Scenarios for Embedding RDF in HTML</a></cite>: <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-1'>Basic Structured Blogging</q>, <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-2'>Publishing an Event - Overriding Some of the Rendered Data</q>, <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-3'>Content Management Metadata</q>, <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-5'>Web Clipboard</q>, <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-7'>Advanced Data Structures</q>, and <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-8'>Augmented Browsing for Scientists</q>, <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-9'>Publishing a RDF Vocabulary</q>. The functional and non-functional requirements from the <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp-ucr/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212233/https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp-ucr/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:33Z'>Linked Data Platform Use Cases and Requirements</a></cite> (<abbr title='Linked Data Platform Use Cases and Requirements'>LDP-UCR</abbr>) are also met from the point of expectations of a client application for authoring, publishing, and sharing content with LDP servers.</p>

                  <p>dokieli uses <cite><a href='#linked-data-notifications'>LDN</a></cite> to send and consume notifications. For example, when a reader comments on a fragment of text in an article, the application discovers the article\u2019s Inbox and sends a notification about the annotation. dokieli also consumes notifications from this Inbox to fetch and display the annotation as marginalia (<a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='#figure-dokieli-annotation'>figure dokieli Web Annotation</a>), or indicates the back-references as in the case with citations. A reader can share a dokieli-enabled article with their contacts; dokieli discovers each contact\u2019s Inbox and sends a notification there (<a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='#figure-dokieli-share'>figure dokieli Share</a>). When editing an article, the author can add a citation. If an Inbox is discovered in the cited article, dokieli sends a notification there to indicate what part of the article was cited by whom and where. dokieli-enabled articles also consume citation notifications to display these metrics for the author and other readers (<a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='#figure-dokieli-citation'>figure dokieli Citations and Notifications</a>).</p>

                  <p>Next I describe dokieli\u2019s architecture according to the following capabilities:</p>

                    <li>Actors use their own WebIDs to identify themselves with, and use their profile information to adapt the user interface.</li>
                    <li>Actors publish and consume human- and machine-readable Linked Data, and decide where they are made available from and the conditions for access and reuse.</li>
                    <li>Actors trigger the notification system to announce, as well as discover relevant information.</li>

The approach also helps to avoid the creation and usage of multiple data islands, ie. separately for humans and machines. Consequently, it has the advantage of not having any dependency on JavaScript in order to make the hidden machine-readable content be consumable from a human user interface.

We cannot know in advance what new kinds of information or data can be integrated into articles, so to facilitate extensibility, dokieli sets no constraints on what information can be embedded nor how it can be be expressed.

All articles, annotations, and notifications can be assembled in various combinations since they are ultimately expressed using the RDF language, which acts as a layer to describe them at any level of abstraction. All units of information in articles, annotations, and notifications are self-contained, context neutral, globally identifiable and accessible without additional processing. Resources can be versioned, marked as immutable, and archived, thereby treating them as stateless entities on the Web. Another way to reuse the resources is by dynamically embedding them in articles while communicating the original context eg. link to the source, parameters in which an annotation was created. Notifications can serve to establish <span id='bi-directional-linking'>bi-directional linking</span> eg. in citations. Articles and annotations can embed media objects eg. images, videos, audio, or documents, as reusable resources.</span></p>

This has the advantage that the annotation has its own inbox, which means it can stand alone and receive replies, or enable threaded conversation on the article itself. The authors of articles or annotations choose their preferred storage location for notifications and assign their inbox accordingly, based on Solid\u2019s Type Index Registration approach.

                      <p>Before dokieli makes a write request to a server, it triggers content-negotiation through <code>HTTP OPTIONS</code> and checks for <code>Allow</code> and <code>Accept-Post</code> HTTP headers in order to determine server\u2019s preferences. In the absence of successful negotiation, dokieli proceeds to make the request as per the required parameters of LDN, WAP and AP. For example, <code>HTTP POST</code> with <code>application/ld+json</code> content type would be used for annotations and notifications, if a server\u2019s preference is not determined.</p>

                      <p>Articles are by default use HTML with embedded RDFa. Where a server implements <code>HTTP GET</code> with <code>text/html</code>, and allows <code>HTTP PUT</code> for writing, the assumption is that it can allow payloads with <code>text/html</code> content type. HTML+RDFa is considered to be an important default for articles for being human- and machine-readable. Hence, if a server is capable of storing and serving resources in HTML, it will receive articles, annotations, and notifications in that form. Otherwise, dokieli will re-serialize the content into an alternative RDF syntax that the server prefers or is capable of handling per content-negotiation.</p>

                        <p>As of this writing, the reasons to use <code>HTTP POST</code> and <code>HTTP PUT</code> over <code>HTTP PATCH</code>, for documents like articles, are as follows:</p>

                        <ul>
                          <li>Servers with <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5261' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212300/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5261' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:00Z'>XML Patch</a></cite> (<abbr title='XML Patch'>RFC 5261</abbr>) and mediatype <code>application/xml-patch+xml</code> \u2013 <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7351' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212300/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7351' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:00Z'>A Media Type for XML Patch Operations</a></cite> (<abbr title='A Media Type for XML Patch Operations'>RFC 7351</abbr>) \u2013  capability in the Linked Data ecosystem are not well supported.</li>

                          <li>Servers implementing <code>HTTP PATCH</code> with <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212300/https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:00Z'>SPARQL Update</a></cite> (using mediatype <code>application/sparql-update</code>) would also need to re-serialize the content eventually as HTML+RDFa.</li>

                          <li><code>HTTP PATCH</code> can help to optimise HTTP requests provided that the server processes the SPARQL query and eventually publishes the final state of the article. dokieli\u2019s use of <code>HTTP POST</code> and <code>HTTP PUT</code> on the other hand does not particularly expect or impose operations other than to eventually store and serve the resource.</li>

                          <li><code>HTTP POST</code> and <code>HTTP PUT</code> are functionally valid. <code>HTTP PATCH</code> can still be used in the future if server implementations can better handle updates to documents encoded in HTML+RDFa.</li>

                      <p>Once an annotation is created and has a dereferenceable HTTP URI (subject to access control rules), a notification can be sent to the inbox of the target resource about the annotation if any part of an article advertises an LDN inbox. Depending on the motivation of the annotation, the notification is modelled with the <cite>Activity vocabulary</cite> eg. the <a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-create'>Create</a> activity (<code>as:Create</code>), to indicate that the actor has created the object.</p>

                      <p>In order to discover and view previously created annotations associated with an article, dokieli follows LDN\u2019s discovery mechanism for notifications about annotations, and then subsequently fetches the annotations in order to display them in context of their target selector.</p>

                      <p>The mechanism for personal identities, social graphs, and self-publishing articles and annotations enables a new layer of decentralised interactions. Here I describe how actors can discover units of information created or annotated in response to Web resources (like articles) by their social network without intermediaries (which includes the authors of the article or the features supported by the server it is published at). This scenario expands on <em>identity A knows identity B</em>, and <em>identity B has a <a href='#profile-knows-profile-storage'>storage</a> or <a href='#profile-knows-profile-outbox'>outbox</a></em> as declared in <a href='#linking-the-decentralised-information-space'>Linking the Decentralised Information Space</a>.</p>

                      <p>As each unit of information can be independently published and made accessible by an actor, one way to discover the information is by determining the relation between their WebID and the location of their collection of artifacts eg. under their personal storage (<code>pim:storage</code>) or activity outbox (<code>as:outbox</code>). The second connection between the actor that is interested in discovering such information and the actors which created them (<code>foaf:knows</code>). Hence, we are able to discover the reactions (like replies, comments, approvals, questioning, or annotations in general) made by the members of an actor\u2019s social graph.</p>

                      <p>In order to realise this scenario, the required components are as follows:</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Actor A wants to read annotations or activities around a unit of information.</li>
                        <li>Actor A knows actor B.</li>
                        <li>Actor B has a collection of artifacts.</li>
                        <li>Actor A has read access to Actor B\u2019s activity collection.</li>
                        <li>Actor A\u2019s application associates the unit of interest with actor B\u2019s annotation or activity.</li>
                        <li>Actor A\u2019s application displays the annotation in context of the unit of information.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>As these components are solely based on interoperable standards, any conforming application is able to interact with them, and perhaps more importantly, is not subject to <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190729124644/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in' data-versiondate='2019-07-29T12:46:44Z'>vendor lock-in</a></cite>.</p>

                      <p>This scenario is realised in dokieli, and works as a <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='#single-page-application'>single-page application</a></cite> or via the <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='#web-browser-extension'>Web browser extension</a></cite>. The Web Extension enables a new dimension to discovering and consuming independently published activities in that, a user can navigate to any HTTP URL and potentially discover and interact with annotations made by the members of their network. Thereby, a layer of decentralised and linked research space can exist independently, where any Web resource, perhaps typically an article, can be incorporated into the social or research discourse.</p>

                      <p>As each annotation (or unit of information) can have its own inbox, subsequent interactions with the annotation can be both stored at the annotator\u2019s storage and notified at the advertised inbox. This further decouples the components required to publish and consume content on the Web in an interoperable way. The decentralised activities in dokieli demonstrates the utility of independent publishing, semantic relations, as well as extensibility of structured Web objects.</p>

                      <p>A key aspect of the Social Web is sharing our creations and interests with the others.

Contacts whose profiles advertise an LDN Inbox will receive a notification of the share. The notification is modelled with the Activity vocabulary, eg. <a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-announce'>Announce</a>, to indicate that the actor is calling the target\u2019s attention to the object.

The registration of units of information with URIs enables us to create RDF relations between citing and cited entities. For example, actors can link to specific statements within and across resources, as well as annotate their intentions while preserving the context when they are created.</p>

                      <p id='contextual-citations'><strong>Contextual Citations</strong>: One way to create a citation in dokieli is by authors selecting a node or a text fragment of interest in their document, and then inserting the URI of the resource to be linked to, as well as a specifying the type of semantic link between them in a specific or general way using the classifications available from the CiTO ontology eg. using <q>agrees with</q>, <q>confirms</q>, <q class='highlight-cites-as-evidence'>cites as evidence</q>. The input for the cited entity can be any HTTP URI, DOI string, or <abbr title='International Standard Serial Number'>ISSN</abbr> string, and when resolved from a corresponding HTTP URL, the content in RDF is used towards constructing the citation. dokieli takes the input target URI, and retrieves data (like title, authors) expressed in RDF in the linked document, integrates a statement expressed in RDF eg. figure <a href='#example-cites-as-evidence'>cites as evidence</a>, in context of the content, the citation intention as human-readable text, and adds a scientific endnote reference including the retrieved information. As a citation results in the assigning an HTTP URI for the citing entity, it can be further semantically annotated by the actor.</p>

                      <p id='notifying-cited-entity'><strong>Notifying Cited Entity</strong>: Once a citation is made through the dokieli user interface, dokieli proceeds to check if the cited resource advertises its own LDN inbox, and if so, sends a notification indicating the citation function. This notification serves as a back-reference announcement, ie. being informed that a citation was made and thus creating discoverable <em>bi-directional linking</em> between the units of information. With the help of an inbox consumer, like dokieli, the cited article can also inform the reader about the back-references out there on the Web.</p>

                      <p>Creating awareness and enabling actors to protect their data privacy is essential to fostering user\u2019s trust in the systems they use. The adoption of standards and practices with different <a href='#degree-of-control'>degree of control</a> can yield different privacy measures. In the decentralised and interoperable environment that dokieli operates in, there are a number of challenges and approaches. I discuss user privacy, data privacy, preferred proxy, and private activities below. The terms <q>anonymity</q>, <q>unlinkability</q>, <q>undetectability</q>, <q>unobservability</q>, and <q>pseudonymity</q> follow the definitions from <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='http://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.34.pdf' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190128120631/http://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.34.pdf' data-versiondate='2019-01-28T12:06:31Z'>A terminology for talking about privacy by data minimization: Anonymity, Unlinkability, Undetectability, Unobservability, Pseudonymity, and Identity Management</a></cite>, Pfitzmann, 2010.</p>

                      <p id='user-privacy'><strong>User Privacy</strong>: dokieli acts as a conduit to perform read-write operations against <abbr title='Personal Data Store'>PDS</abbr>. As the rules for read-write operations are set by servers, dokieli does not require the creation of user accounts at any server, in order to interact with the server\u2019s resources. Where applicable, actors can participate by maintaining their <em>anonymity</em>, <em>pseudonymity</em>, or can choose to identify themselves to dokieli by using their preferred <a href='#personal-identities'>personal identities</a>, without necessarily disclosing "real" information. Actors authenticate against the servers they prefer in order to perform access-controlled actions. It is possible for the environment in which dokieli operates in to transmit device, machine, or browser fingerprint, thereby potentially risking <em>unlinkability</em> \u2013 however, they are outside the control and scope of dokieli.</p>

                      <p id='data-privacy'><strong>Data Privacy</strong>: With respect to data privacy, actors can exercise their autonomy through the use of PDS for their profiles, articles, annotations, and notifications. As a <a href='#pds-expectation'>PDS can provide</a> us with the means to safeguard data, dokieli as a clientside application enables actors to perform <a href='#read-write-linked-data'>read-write Linked Data</a> operations where they prefer under their own conditions. With the help of access controls, a PDS that dokieli communicates with can potentially fulfill all minimizations \u2013 <q>anonymity</q>, <q>unlinkability</q>, <q>undetectability</q>, <q>unobservability</q>, <q>pseudonymity</q> \u2013 possibly with the exception of the domain name and IP that the PDS operates from.</p>

                      <p id='preferred-proxy'><strong>Preferred Proxy</strong>: A proxy acts as an intermediary between the clientside application and the destination server. This is useful in a number of scenarios for dokieli, such as getting around <a href='#mixed-content'>Mixed Content</a> issues, absence of <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212302/https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:02Z'>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</a></cite> (<abbr title='Cross-Origin Resource Sharing'>CORS</abbr>) support, as well as concealing the identity of the actor, fulfilling <em>anonymity</em>, <em>unlinkability</em>, <em>pseudonymity</em>, when making requests to a target server. An actor\u2019s preferred proxy can be determined by checking their WebID Profile description for the <code>solid:preferredProxy</code> relation, and if found, dokieli can use it to route requests when needed. Alternatively, a built-in (but user configurable) proxy location in dokieli is used.</p>

                      <p>dokieli is a clientside application that uses the user-agent to interact with server applications. It has two deployment approaches including the same set of features: <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:02Z'>single-page application</a></cite> and <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_extension' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_extension' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:02Z'>Web browser extension</a></cite>.</p>

                      <p id='single-page-application'>dokieli\u2019s presentational and behavioural code layers can be included in Web "pages" in order to trigger them as active single-page applications. It is a smart client that allows different kinds of articles eg. academic, blog posts, news, to be authored and annotated from within Web browsers, without necessarily having them deployed from a server, ie. it can be used offline or on localhost. dokieli internally handles its content and structural and semantic representation based on user\u2019s actions and available information. Articles, profiles and their contact information, notifications, annotations with different motivations, for instance, can be read and written ubiquitously to any Web space with supporting HTTP methods and access control mechanisms.</p>

                      <p id='web-browser-extension'>The Web browser extension is a thin wrapper around dokieli\u2019s core code in order to embed itself in any HTML-based Web page on the Web. It inherits all of the features of a single-page application. While HTML based documents on the Web vary in their quality, dokieli\u2019s write operations generate HTML+RDFa. One of the utilities for the extension is to have a consistent interface for annotating node or text selections on a Web resource, building structured citations, creating derivations of Web resources as well as sharing document fragments with ones contacts via notifications, without having a service dependency or being limited by the Web page\u2019s UI.</p>

        "\n                  <p>Given that global strategic research is influenced by policies and industry, different <em>information spaces</em> can be created by an ensemble of units of information. Such information spaces would serve to facilitate knowledge exchange in the scientific communication market. In this section, I investigate existing approaches towards configuring different aspects of Web-centric information spaces.</p>\n\n                  <p id='knowledge-graphs'>Scholarly knowledge includes a range of research artifacts that needs to be described, uniquely identifiable and be discoverable on the Web. These include research articles, peer reviews, research data, social interactions like review requests and notifications in general, as well as different kinds of annotations on research objects. The current state of access and use of scholarly knowledge is insufficient for society at large. By enabling accessible <q cite='http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2019/10328/pdf/dagrep_v008_i009_p029_18371.pdf#subsection.3.25'>Scholarly Knowledge</q> (<cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2019/10328/pdf/dagrep_v008_i009_p029_18371.pdf' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190325111930/http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2019/10328/pdf/dagrep_v008_i009_p029_18371.pdf' data-versiondate='2019-03-25T11:19:30Z'>Knowledge Graphs: New Directions for Knowledge Representation on the Semantic Web</a></cite>) graphs as well as applications which make use of it, we hope to enable universal access to previous research. By improving the availability through linked research, we can facilitate discovery and building on existing research. A fundamental first step is to investigate and develop effective ways to represent fine-grained information that is accessible, human- and machine-readable, and interconnected.</p>\n\n                  <p id='involving-scholarly-communication'>A typical high-level interplay between the <em>actors</em> and the <em>content</em> forces, and their functions (registration, awareness, certification, archive) in scholarly communication have authors reply to call for contributions by sharing their literature. Reviewers provide feedback on the research results; individuals annotate and re-share the literature; editors filter and assemble a collection of work; archives are notified about the research. While the document-centric Web was mostly for human-readability, Linked Data-based Web is oriented towards improving discoverability, readability, and reuse for machines, and in effect better helping humans. For example, if research articles capture their <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/web-science-from-404-to-200#problem-space'>problem statements</a>, <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/call-for-linked-research#no-central-authority'>motivation</a>, <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/sense-of-lsd-analysis#hypothesis-null'>hypothesis</a>, <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/cooling-down-web-science#introduction'>arguments</a>, <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/enabling-accessible-knowledge#workflow'>workflow steps</a>, <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/sense-of-lsd-analysis#methodology'>methodology</a>, <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#protocol'>design</a>, <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-statistical-data-analysis#results'>results</a>, <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#analysis-and-evaluation'>evaluation</a>, <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-research-scholarly-communication#conclusions'>conclusions</a>, <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/dokieli#next-steps'>future challenges</a>, as well as all <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://dokie.li/#figure-dokieli-citation'>inline semantic citations</a> (to name <em>a few</em>) where they are uniquely identified, related to other data, and discoverable, then specialised software can be used to verify the article\u2019s well-formedness with respect to the domain. In essence, this materialises the possibility of articles being executable towards reproduction of computational results. Similarly, user interfaces can manifest environments where readers can rerun experiments or observe the effects of changing the input parameters of an algorithm. This has the affordance for a more <a title='Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction' href='http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/'>involving environment for the user</a>, improves learnability of material, and supersedes the passive mode of reading.</p>\n\n                  <p id='practical-knowledge-representation-for-the-web'>In a 1999 article, <cite><a rel='cito:obtainsBackgroundFrom' href='https://www.cs.vu.nl/~frankh/postscript/IJCAI99-III.html' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20181229164515/https://www.cs.vu.nl/~frankh/postscript/IJCAI99-III.html' data-versiondate='2018-12-29T16:45:15Z'>Practical Knowledge Representation for the Web</a></cite>, Van Harmelen, 1999, stated that <q>the lack of semantic markup is a major barrier to the development of more intelligent document processing on the Web</q>, and <q>meta-data annotation of Web sources is essential for applying AI techniques on a large and successful scale</q>.</p>\n\n                  <p>In this section I examine some of the existing Web standards and practices for the structure and semantics of scholarly information with focus on narrative documents and observational data. Scholarly documents with the characteristics of a continuous prose, such as those of research articles typically includes factual information about an investigation with supporting provenance-level information and references to underlying data. Annotations in the general sense can be similar to articles, however they are generally intended to encapsulate an indirection where target resources are associated with annotation activities with motivations, eg. commenting, bookmarking, or classifying. Notifications for scholarly activities serve as a way to inform a target of interest about events in general. I also examine representation and publication of statistical, experimental, or observational data on the Web following the Linked Data design principles.</p>\n\n                  <p>One goal here is to identify and apply patterns so that content creators can register different units of information at varying semantic granularity. Ultimately, I seek solutions that embrace interoperability and reusability, device and medium independence, as well as favourable for accessibility and archiving.</p>\n                "^^rdf:HTML;

        "\n                  <p>In this section I reflect on what the findings of this thesis can mean to us and why we should care.</p>\n\n                  <p id='paygo-linked-data'><strong>PAYGO Linked Data</strong>: Publishing units of communication by following the Linked Data principles is similar to the <cite><a href='#paygo'>pay as you go</a></cite> approach in dataspace systems in that knowledge on the Web can be extended incrementally without having everything up front or even a commitment to do so. This is particularly evident when disparate collection of units (or graphs) published by different entities can be connected when they share globally identifiable entities, as well as being universally useful when the content they identify is accessible.</p>\n\n                  <p id='fair-linked-data'><strong>FAIR Linked Data</strong>: For openly accessible resources, I note that the <cite><a href='#linked-data'>Linked Data</a></cite> approach and technology stack can fulfill the <cite><a href='#fair-guiding-principles'>FAIR guiding principles</a></cite>. One generalisation that could be made from this is that Linked Data design principles can be adopted as a base requirement when building interoperable Web applications, which would also fulfill FAIR. After all, the FAIR principles does not prescribe the mechanisms for Web data, and as such, interoperability across applications for independently produced FAIR-conformance is not systematically guaranteed. In contrast, the Linked Data approach specifies the mechanisms within the framework of the <cite><a href='#architecture-of-the-web'>Architecture of the Web</a></cite> and guarantees interop.</p>\n\n                  <p id='decentralised-identity-and-authentication'><strong>Decentralised Identity and Authentication</strong>: Applications primarily operate in a read-only information space in the absence of decentralised identities and authentication mechanisms. Client applications can be loosely coupled with servers when the source of authentication is distributed. Actors can use independently built client applications to perform CRUD operations provided that they can authenticate using their preferred WebID, as well as have the possibility to decide on the storage location of their data. Thus, it is possible to distribute scholarly contributions on the Web based on an actor (or contributor) centric model.</p>\n\n                  <p id='interoperable-applications'><strong>Interoperable Applications</strong>: Decoupling of the forces and functions in scholarly communication in context of the Web necessitates interoperable applications through the use of standard data formats and communication protocols. These class of applications need to only reflect user\u2019s intent within the frame of a loosely coupled system design. That is, applications having semantic understanding of the affordances of the system makes it possible to automate information exchange. Consequently enabling users to switch between standards-compliant applications without interfering with existing data. For instance, HTTP, URI, and HTML are widely used standards on the Web enabling us to use any user agent (like a Web browser) on the Open Web Platform. Similarly, one layer up on the interoperability ladder would be to employ communication protocols and data formats that are capable of addressing specific use cases.</p>\n\n                  <p id='sociotechnical-centralisation'><strong>Sociotechnical Centralisation</strong>: We can observe different forms of centralisation within decentralisation. As we adopt mechanisms with the intention of decentralisation and interoperability, are we free of all forms of centralisation and vendor lock-ins? For instance, <cite><a href='#uri-ownership'>URI Ownership</a></cite> discussed the inherent social centralisation of DNS in that individuals merely rent domain names from registrars and maintain the mapping to physical servers. <cite><a href='#semantic-organisation-of-notifications'>Semantic Organisation of Notifications</a></cite> highlights one form of organic centralisation around the choice of Linked Data vocabularies that the applications make use of. Technical Web specifications for the most part reflect the group\u2019s goals, cultural norms or biases. For instance, LDN was initially incubated in the <cite><a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://solid.mit.edu/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190628115812/https://solid.mit.edu/' data-versiondate='2019-06-28T11:58:12Z'>Solid project</a></cite> within the understanding of a socially-aware read-write Linked Data paradigm, and then developed to be a technical specification through the W3C <abbr title='Social Web Working Group'>SWWG</abbr> as part of a broader context of decentralisation efforts.</p>\n\n                  <p id='aaa-raca'><strong>AAA in RACA</strong>: <cite><a href='#function-of-peer-review'>Function of Peer Review</a></cite> noted the intentions and limits of peer review in context of the Web. It is neither the case that the right, the privilege, or the practice of the notion <q><a href='#aaa'>anyone being (technically) allowed to say anything about anything</a></q> is exempt from ethical considerations. As we have seen in modern Web social media, management and distribution of misinformation and disinformation is profitable and poses a danger to civilisation. For instance, as electronic publication has also been blurring the lines between academic work and personal opinions, making the distinction between the two as part of the scientific endeavour has only become more vital. In that respect, the notion of <cite><a href='#self-publishing'>self-publishing</a></cite> does not entail quality-controlled and certified units of communication in and itself, but rather focuses on increasing actors\u2019 immediate role and control. Thus, trust and accountability remain as social processes.</p>\n\n                  <p id='school-of-thought'><strong>School of Thought</strong>: Some of dokieli\u2019s design decisions were driven by the need to enable actors to autonomously participate in a decentralised scholarly ecosystem. With respect to the four functions in scientific communication, the expectations are to operate under a <em>deconstructed</em> or <em>decoupled</em> model while providing high <cite><a href='#degree-of-control'>Degree of Control</a></cite> to content creators and consumers, as well as generating and reusing interoperable data. This approach shares some conceptual similarities to the <q cite='http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ginsparg/physics/blurb/pg01unesco.html'>self-archiving</q> approach in that scholars have the right to freely share their Web resources from open repositories. However, a distinction between the <q>self-archiving</q> initiative and <cite><a href='#self-publishing'>self-publishing</a></cite> in context of the <cite><a href='#linked-research'>Linked Research</a></cite> goal can be made in that while an actor may prefer to share their contributions through third-party controlled components, the baseline for <q>self-publishing</q> is that they are not required to. Thus, the network location and the applications that are used to make the content available are orthogonal to the notion of what constitutes a scholarly contribution. Lastly, parallel characteristics between dokieli\u2019s approach and the <cite><a href='#republic-of-letters'>Republic of Letters</a></cite> can be made in that both operate under the idea of scholarly activities to be a researcher-centric model \u2013 direct information exchange between authors and readers \u2013 without requiring intermediaries.</p>\n                "^^rdf:HTML;

It is about modern research communication, and just because it is there, shapes the way we think and behave; and why it exists in the form it does, and who or what was responsible for it to exist at all. What is an alternative way of change?</p>\n\n                  <p id='sociotechnical-transformations'>The idiosyncratic relationships between technological breakthroughs and societal transformations throughout history are intrinsically intertwined. It was not until I came across <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connections_%28TV_series%29' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709103110/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connections_%28TV_series%29' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:31:10Z'>Connections</a></cite>, the TV series by James Burke that I had a glimpse of the phenomenon about the increasingly interlinked human endeavours over time. After encountering Marshall McLuhan\u2019s theories on communication and how media have the power to shape and transform human nature, what to do next was mostly clear (in my head). Given these realisations or perspectives as a foundation, being a Web technologist only enabled me to build the necessary connections between what was previously missing or underdeveloped. The rest was mostly a matter of struggling with the ghost in the machine and working alongside our shared social challenges.</p>\n\n                  <p id='web-as-an-extension'>Ironically, even today, academics essentially operate within a paper-centric framework to create and disseminate publicly-funded knowledge by usually delegating it to third-party publishers which still operate in the 15th century. Meanwhile, the Web \u2013 if we can anthropomorphise for a moment \u2013 is disappointed by the distracted academics\u2019 practices. I took the liberty to test the boundaries and demonstrate some of the aspects of what the native affordances of the Web provided \u2013 an extension of our central nervous system.</p>\n\n                  <p id='information-society'>I live in an <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_society' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190729074950/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_society' data-versiondate='2019-07-29T07:49:50Z'>information society</a></cite>, which makes use of variety of communication media to meet societal needs. The Web has shaped social policies and practices around the world, as well as influence the creation and use of other technologies. It has also reconfigured individuals to be active participants in global information exchange, as well as passive consumers partly due to the abundance of instantaneously available multimedia. To date \u2013 30 years old as of this writing \u2013 the Web is considered to be a net positive for society all meanwhile open and complex challenges remain. Like any human technology, what we devise and how we use them has societal implications.</p>\n\n                  <p id='the-story'>We can start this story from anywhere. I argue that in order to best contextualise this thesis, it is essential to operate under the understanding of communication mediums and scientific revolutions, as well as their effects on society. This is especially because the research goals of this thesis at its core is <em>sociotechnical</em>, and that a clear division between them will not do its justice. I believe that in order to push the boundaries of our knowledge further, it necessitates a multidisciplinary undertaking \u2013 taken <q cite='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_of_salt'>with a grain of salt</q>. One overarching goal is to foster the social machinery from different perspectives that is required to build a knowledge Web for any type of user; human, machine, or other. While I set the problem context to scholarly communication, applications of the knowledge and generated artifacts are potentially applicable to other initiatives in society.</p>\n\n                  <p id='assumptions'>I assume that researchers in scholarly communication are motivated to some extent personally, whether that is with the goal to take part in advancing collective knowledge, society and life, career advancement, prestige, or financial gain. Researchers are intrinsically interested in making their impact by way of sharing their findings in a manner that is most accessible to potential users. As for the underlying technical machinery for information exchange, I assume that it is useful to aim in designing interoperable information systems to help us address problems in context of societal goals. All of these aspects are part of the <q cite='http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/729965164'>social machine</q> of scholarly communication, and are explored through the sections.</p>\n\n                  <p id='up-next'>As many have argued, for scholarly communication to be more effective; accessible, usable, inclusive, as well as equitable, we need to adopt methods that are better at identifying and making use of the native affordances of the Web. This is particularly important today since academic and social activities use the Web as the primary medium to communicate (in contrast to systems that mimic paper media). Hence, I examine the core characteristics of the Web, discuss the state of affairs in scholarly communication, and share my findings on how a way to fulfill the forces and functions in scientific communication can be met by a socially-aware decentralised client application along with an ocean of open Web standards at its disposal.</p>\n                </div>\n              </section>\n\n              <p id='framing-design-science'>In order to frame the <q>design science</q> of this thesis, the sections on <cite><a href='#research-goals'>Research Goals</a></cite> and <cite><a href='#research-questions'>Research Questions</a></cite> are based on <cite>Research Goals and Research Questions</cite> in <cite><a rel='cito:usesMethodIn' href='https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783662438381-c1.pdf' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190314101015/https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783662438381-c1.pdf' data-versiondate='2019-03-14T10:10:15Z'>Design Science Methodology for Information Systems and Software Engineering</a></cite>, Wieringa, 2014.</p>\n\n              <section resource='#research-goals' rel='schema:hasPart' inlist='' id='research-goals'>\n                <h3 property='schema:name'>Research Goals</h3>\n                <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>\n                  <p>This section contains the <em>outlines</em> for social and technical research goals of this thesis.

However, humans and machines have restricted access, are required to pay, or hindered to efficiently discover, make sense of, and create new connections between information.</p>\n\n                      <p id='non-interoperable-web-systems'>Data on the Web tends to be locked into non-interoperable Web systems or be only usable by applications which created it. Actors \u2013 creators and readers \u2013 in these systems often do not have the means to switch between applications and share data between them.</p>\n\n                      <p id='lack-of-diverse-value-chains'>There is a lack of diverse value chains for different units of scholarly communication due to tightly coupled proprietary systems. The actors in these systems create and exchange information by (being forced into) using packaged systems and workflows, give up their rights, and not have control over how their creations can be disseminated and reused.</p>\n\n                      <p id='web-affordances-neglected'>The actors in the system commonly use print-centric tools and data representations to exchange content on the Web and neglect to take advantage of the available affordances of the Web (media). Actors\u2019 possibility to shape their contributions in Web media is typically constrained to third-party service provider\u2019s centralised and non-interoperable solutions.</p>\n\n                      <p id='identifier-data-privacy'>Actors\u2019 use of personal and professional identifiers, as well as data storage from third-parties are subject to privacy issues. Actors typically manage multiple disconnected profiles, social connections, and data spaces.</p>\n\n                      <p id='global-deficiencies'>These class of problems in the scholarly ecosystem have implications on access, interoperability, findability, cost and privacy. Consequently, resulting in global deficiencies in the ecosystem. The research questions; <cite><a href='#technical-research-problems'>Technical Research Problems</a></cite> and <cite><a href='#knowledge-questions'>Knowledge Questions</a></cite>, are aimed at understanding the internal mechanisms of these type of problems and address them for stakeholders.</p>\n                    </div>\n                  </section>\n\n                  <section resource='#technical-research-goals' rel='schema:hasPart' inlist='' id='technical-research-goals'>\n                    <h4 property='schema:name'>Technical Research Goals</h4>\n                    <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>\n                      <p>Given the <cite><a href='#problem-context'>Problem Context</a></cite>, the technical goals of this thesis are to identify gaps in the Web standards landscape and to create new technical standards where necessary.

LDN can facilitate the realisation of interconnecting scholarly communication systems as posited in <cite>Rethinking Scholarly Communication</cite>.</p>\n\n                  <p id='ldn-forces'>Assuming multiple interoperating implementations of LDN, I observe the <em>forces</em>:</p>\n\n                  <dl>\n                    <dt>Actors</dt>\n                    <dd>The actors involved in executing the LDN protocol can be categorised into documents (or things, or entities) and software applications. An LDN target (like a document or a researcher profile) with an inbox is the actor that affords the start of any communication. Applications consist of LDN implementations with one or more roles: sender, receiver, and consumer, with the purpose of delivering information to or about a target that can be used by interested parties.</dd>\n\n                    <dt>Content</dt>\n                    <dd>Target resources, inboxes, and notifications collectively comprise the content in LDN\u2019s flow. That is, any target resource advertising an inbox relation; an inbox description with a collection of notifications (with optional data about creating and using notifications), and individual notifications with any RDF contents. A notification\u2019s content can include or refer to any unit of information or communication in the scientific and scholarly system.</dd>\n\n                    <dt>Accessibility</dt>\n                    <dd>An inbox and its notifications are made <em>available</em> to users and applications via HTTP over a network connection.

LDN can be used to inform systems that a registration of a unit of information took place; a request for quality-control and verification is sought-after, or has occurred; and for instance, an archiving service is informed to place a request for preserving the units.</dd>\n\n                    <dt>Certification</dt>\n                    <dd>LDN can be implemented to support scholarly certification mechanisms. Notifications can be sent to request review, as well to return the results of a certification process such as a registered unit of information\u2019s significance and soundness. Units of information at any level of granularity can be referenced in notifications, from entire articles to individual data points. Similarly, information about a revocation of a unit of information can be circulated.</dd>\n\n                    <dt>Archiving</dt>\n                    <dd>LDN can be implemented to support archival processes.

                      <p>The Web architecture initially used HTML as the language to represent and connect hypermedia documents with one another. HTML\u2019s success is indisputable today, and that\u2019s perhaps due to its simplicity to create and reuse; its flexibility, for partial understanding to proceed; and its extensibility to allow language mixing.  While the HTML specification continues to evolve by reflecting on the needs of the Web, by design it is scoped to creating and connecting Web documents and applications.</p>

RDF is a constructed machine-interpretable language to describe and interlink arbitrary things at any level of abstraction on the Web, and reuses the existing architecture of the Web. In <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='http://www.ibiblio.org/hhalpin/homepage/thesis/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20181231104602/http://www.ibiblio.org/hhalpin/homepage/thesis/' data-versiondate='2018-12-31T10:46:02Z'>Sense and Reference on the Web</a></cite>, Halpin, 2009, states that in the context of RDF (and the <q>Principle of Linking</q>), <q resource='http://www.ibiblio.org/hhalpin/homepage/thesis/#SECTION00622000000000000000' rel='cito:includesQuotationFrom' cite='http://www.ibiblio.org/hhalpin/homepage/thesis/#SECTION00622000000000000000'>URIs are primarily referential and may not lead to access unlike links in traditional hypertext systems</q>.</p>

                      <p id='rdf-unifying-language'>Conceptually, RDF was in the fabric of the Web from the start. By <em>naming</em> things with URIs, we can construct structured sentences with RDF. By comparison, HTML at its core is a terse approach to representing and linking knowledge. RDF on the other hand is intended to be a unifying language for machine interfaces to data systems. I will further discuss language mixing with RDF in HTML and XML-family languages via <cite><a href='#rdfa'>RDFa</a></cite>.</p>

                      <p id='aaa'>One conceptual view of the Web is that <q cite='https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/RDFnot#ER'>anyone being (technically) allowed to say anything about anything</q> (<abbr title='Anyone can say Anything about Anything'>AAA</abbr>). One consequence of AAA is that while systems (and reasoners within) can operate under both the <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world_assumption' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105644/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world_assumption' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:44Z'>open-world assumption</a></cite> (<abbr title='Open-world Assumption'>OWA</abbr>) or the <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-world_assumption' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105644/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-world_assumption' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:44Z'>closed-world assumption</a></cite> (<abbr title='Closed-world Assumption'>CWA</abbr>), the Web ultimately uses the OWA framework because new knowledge can always make its way into the system, and lack of knowledge does not imply falsity. RDF applies a particular restriction of the AAA principle in that nonsensical, inconsistent, or conflicting information can be created or inferred. It is up to processing applications to determine their confidence on the information. Hence, an important distinction: assertions made using the RDF language are claims, as opposed to facts.</p>

                  <p>As scholarly content is created and registered, becoming globally identifiable on the Web, the next challenge is to ensure it is <em>findable</em> and <em>discoverable</em> within a decentralised system.</p>
                  <p>I have <a href='#decentralising-scholarly-communication'>reviewed</a> a number of Web standards and specifications pertaining to <a href='#read-write-linked-data'>read-write Linked Data</a>, vocabularies about <a href='#publishing-and-referencing'>publishing resources</a> and <a href='#participation'>social participation</a>, and explained how they can be combined in various ways to realise a wide array of scholarly and social activities in a decentralised fashion. This section describes the design and standardisation of a decentralised notification system that works on the HTTP application layer.</p>

                  <p>Notifications are sent over the Web for a variety of purposes, including social applications: <q>You have been invited to a vegan lunch!</q>, <q>Guinan annotated your article</q>, <q>Eunice tagged you in a photo</q>. The notification data may be displayed to a human to acknowledge, or used to trigger some other application-specific process (or both). Such notifications are also useful as part of a decentralised scholarly communications ecosystem, primarily for fulfilling the <em>awareness</em> function.</p>

                  <p>Notifications are a common part of many centralised Web applications, and variety of uses are in social media. In this case, notifications are structured arbitrarily and are typically only usable by the sanctioned applications or those that generated them in the first place. So far, notifications are <em>ephemeral</em> resources which may disappear after delivery, and thus are not designed for reuse. In such systems, communication and semantic interoperability across independently built applications is not expected. This design however places limitations on possible interactions around a notification. For example, current major social media services on the Web act as disjoint closed ecosystems, commonly known as <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform'>walled gardens</a></q> in contrast to open platforms with more possibilities for extensibility and reuse of applications and content. In essence, notification data is locked into particular systems, and users are restricted to using tightly coupled applications. Such software and systems are only capable of exchanging notifications if they have prior knowledge about the actors involved, location of the data, data formats, and user interfaces. Customarily, switching applications entails switching social providers, and having to create new profiles, and yet again reconnect or build one\u2019s social network in the new system from scratch. This scenario is analogous to using an email application that\u2019s customised to each service provider, and only being able to send and receive emails from people that use the same provider. In order for information to flow between systems customised communication interfaces or APIs need to be created after the fact, thus imposing additional maintenance tax for systems to cooperate.</p>

                  <p>In a decentralised architecture, notifications can be a key element for federation of information, and application integration. Current efforts towards <em>re-decentralising</em> the Web are moving towards architectures in which data storage is decoupled from application logic, freeing end users to switch between applications, or to let multiple applications operate over the same data.</p>

                  <p>Similarly for a decentralised scholarly Web, notification data should not be locked into particular systems. Data generated from independently built applications should be discoverable and increase their chance for reusability by other applications. Users can choose where to store their notifications as well as using their preferred applications to create, discover, and consume the data.</p>

                  <p>This section addresses the following <a href='#research-questions'>research question</a> for this thesis:</p>

                  <blockquote cite='#technical-research-problems-mechanisms'>

                  <p>The following are core requirements of a notifications protocol in context of <cite><a href='#degree-of-control'>Degree of Control</a></cite>:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Actors can use their preferred applications to discover, reuse, and send notifications.</li>
                    <li>Actors store incoming notifications where they prefer.</li>
                    <li>Actors switching between applications without having to move their data.</li>
                    <li>Actors change the location of their data without having to change their application.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>In the following subsections I review existing decentralised protocols for notifications, and then outline use cases for notifications in scholarly communication. These use cases yield key design considerations, which are taken into account for the design of a new protocol \u2013 Linked Data Notifications (LDN) \u2013 which can be implemented to meet the awareness function for scholarly communication in decentralised systems, as well as meet the degree of control requirements listed above. LDN also supports systems with respect to the registration, certification and archiving functions.</p>

                  <p>I developed LDN and served as the specification editor as part of the W3C Social Web Working Group (<abbr title='Social Web Working Group'>SWWG</abbr>), and LDN became a W3C Recommendation in May 2017. This section outlines key features and discusses design decisions made in the context of scholarly communication; for reference the specification in its entirety can be found at <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/'>https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/</a>.</p>

                <h3 property='schema:name'>Overview of Web Notification Systems</h3>
                <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                  <p>Many systems which make use of notifications operate either in a completely centralised way, or are decentralised only in the sense that different instances of the <em>same</em> codebase need to interoperate; this review is restricted to mechanisms which do not expect the notification to be received or used only by the same software or platform which sent it.</p>

                  <p>Existing decentralised notification mechanisms can be grouped according to the notification contents. Notification contents are either: 1) One or more URLs, indicating relations between Web resources (aka a \u2018thin ping\u2019), or 2) a \u2018fat ping\u2019 containing a blob of information. Semantic Pingback, Webmention, and Provenance Pingback follow the first form, and are also known as <cite>linkbacks</cite>, the suite of protocols that essentially allows Web documents to automatically reciprocate hyperlinks. This has the advantage that a verification mechanism can be tightly specified (the URL of the target must appear in the content of the source), but the disadvantage that notifications are generally suitable for website publishing. Fat pings, in contrast, are flexible and extensible in that payloads can be in any content type, carry any information, and be used for various use cases.</p>

Resources which are the target for a notification advertise the respective receiving service or endpoint via a <code>Link</code> relation, either in HTTP headers or HTML. Semantic Pingback additionally enables discovery of the Pingback service where target description is available in RDF. While the content at source may indicate (in any convention or serialisation format) the type of relation between the source and target URLs, this information about the relation is not transmitted to the receiver\u2019s endpoint; only the source and target URLs are sent. As such, there is also no way to deterministically distinguish between multiple mentions of the target at the source based on the information in the mention. Hence, each receiver implementation is responsible for interpreting the underlying information at the source, thereby potentially inconsistent across implementations. In contrast, Semantic Pingback does encourage generation of additional semantics about the relation(s) between the source and the target by processing the source as RDF if possible, and also defines specific ways for a receiving server to handle incoming pingback data in order to add the source data to an RDF knowledge base. Beyond verifying that the source contains the URL of the target, Webmention does not specify any further requirements of the receiving server; nor is it expected that \u201cmentions\u201d are retrievable once they have been sent.</p>

                  <p>A useful decentralised notification protocol would be able to realise some of these use cases for scholars. In the next section I describe specific design considerations derived from these uses cases, which can be used to inform the design of the protocol.</p>
                </div>

                <h3 property='schema:name'>Design Considerations</h3>
                <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                  <p>This section details design considerations for a decentralised notification protocol are based on the <cite><a href='#use-cases-for-decentralised-notifications'>Use Cases for Decentralised Notifications</a></cite>. I will take conformance to the Linked Data design principles into account, as well as Web application best practices. I use these considerations to establish the concrete requirements and the points of implementation-specific flexibility for the protocol.</p>

                  <p>The non-functional features include: modularity, reusability, persistence and retrievability, adaptability. The functional features include: target representation, notification body, notification verification, subscribing.</p>

                  <p id='modularity'><strong>Modularity</strong> (<a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#modularity'>R1</a>): To encourage modularity of applications, one should differentiate between different classes of implementation of the protocol. Two parties are involved in the creation of a notification: a <em>sender</em>, generating the notification data, and a <em>receiver</em>, storing the created resource. We also have the role of a <em>consumer</em>, which reads the notification data made available by a receiver, and repurposes it in some way. A software implementation can of course play two or all three of these roles; the important part is that it need not. A consuming application can read and use notification data without being concerned about ever sending or storing notifications.</p>

                  <p id='reusability'><strong>Reusability</strong> (<a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#reusable-notifications'>R2</a>): The relationship between the <em>consumer</em> and <em>receiver</em> roles is key to notifications being reusable. A consumer must be able to autonomously find the location of notifications for or about the particular resource it is interested in. To achieve this, we place a requirement on the receiver to expose notifications it has been sent in such away to permit consumer applications to access them; and specify how any resource can advertise its receiving endpoint for consumers to discover. To promote fair use or remixing of notification contents, applications can incorporate rights and licensing information into the data. Similarly, applications may include additional information on licensing resources that the notification refers to. The presence of this type of information is important for consumers to assess the (re)usability of data.</p>

                  <p id='persistence-and-retrievability'><strong>Persistence and Retrievability</strong> (<a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#persistence-and-retrievability'>R3</a>): Given the traditionally ephemeral nature of notifications, here we refer to persistence as units of information that can be registered. Applications may benefit from referring to or reusing notifications if the notifications are known to be retrievable in the long term, or indicate their expected lifespan. This enforces the notion that notifications are considered resources in their own right, with their own dereferencable URIs.</p>

                  <p id='adaptability'><strong>Adaptability</strong> (<a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#adaptability'>R4</a>): A notification protocol should be adaptable for different domains, but that there is no need to create multiple domain-specific notification protocols; the fundamental mechanics are the same given the three main architectural layers of the Web \u2013 identification, interaction, data formats.</p>

                  <p id='target-representation'><strong>Target representation</strong> (<a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#target-representation'>R4-A</a>): Any resource may be the <em>target</em> of a notification. By target, we mean a notification may be addressed <em>to</em> the resource, be <em>about</em> the resource, or for a sender to otherwise decide that it is appropriate to draw the attention of the resource (or resource owner) to the information in the notification body. As such, any Web resource must be able to advertise an endpoint to which it can receive notifications. Resources can be RDF or non-RDF (such as an image, or CSV dataset), and may be informational (a blog post, a user profile) or non-informational (a person).</p>

                  <p id='notification-body'><strong>Notification body</strong> (<a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#notification-body'>R4-B</a>): We consider the <em>contents</em> of a notification to be application specific because different domains have different needs. From a sender\u2019s perspective, we permit a notification to contain <em>any data</em>, and a notification can use <em>any vocabulary</em>. From a consumer\u2019s perspective, interoperability between different applications occurs through vocabulary reuse, and shared understanding of terms. This is in accordance with Linked Data principles in general. The practical upshot of this is that a calendar application which consumes event invitations using the <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfcal/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212251/https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfcal/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:51Z'>RDF Calendar</a></cite> vocabulary is likely to completely ignore notifications containing the <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212209/https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:09Z'>PROV Ontology</a></cite>, even if it finds them all stored in the same place. For two independent applications operating in the <em>same</em> domain, a shared understanding of appropriate vocabulary terms is assumed.</p>

                  <p id='notification-verification'><strong>Notification verification</strong> (<a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#notification-verification'>R4-C</a>): From a receiver\u2019s perspective, exposing itself to receive any blobs of RDF data from unknown senders may be problematic. Thus, it should be possible for the receiver to enforce restrictions and accept only notifications that are acceptable according to its own criteria (deemed by eg. user configuration; domain-specific receivers). This can be used as an anti-spam measure, a security protection, or for attaining application and data integrity.</p>

                  <p id='subscribing'><strong>Subscribing</strong> (<a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications#subscribing'>R5</a>): In general, applications may require that new notifications are pushed to them in real-time, or to request them at appropriate intervals. To take this into account, we expand our definition of senders, receivers and consumers with the following interaction expectations: notifications are <em>pushed</em> from senders to receivers; and <em>pulled</em> from receivers by consumers.</p>

                  <p id='design-intent'>We designed the LDN protocol to support sharing and reuse of notifications <em>across</em> applications, regardless of how they were generated or what their contents are. I describe how the principles of identification, addressability and semantic representation can be applied to notifications on the Web. Specifying LDN as a formal protocol allows independently implemented, heterogeneous applications which generate and use notifications, to seamlessly work together. Thus, LDN supports the decentralisation of the Web as well as encourages the generation and consumption of Linked Data.</p>

                  <p id='design-decision'>LDN is built on existing W3C standards and Linked Data principles. In particular, the storage of notifications is compatible with the <cite>Linked Data Platform</cite> specification; notifications are identified by HTTP URIs; and notification contents are available as JSON-LD (or other RDF syntaxes as per content-negotiation). A key architectural decision is the separation of concerns between <em>senders</em>, <em>receivers</em>, and <em>consumers</em> of notifications. Implementations of the protocol can play one or more of these roles, and interoperate successfully with implementations playing the complementary roles. This means that notifications generated by one application can be reused by a completely different application, accessed via the store where the notification data resides, through shared Linked Data vocabularies. LDN also pushes the decentralised approach further by allowing any <em>target</em> resource to advertise its Inbox anywhere on the Web; that is, targets do not need to be coupled with or controlled by a receiver operating from the same server, and can make use of a third-party <em>inbox-as-a-service</em>.</p>

                  <p>Beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia, LDN senders and consumers need little to no prior knowledge about how to interact with receivers. Furthermore, senders and consumers determine a target\u2019s inbox location dynamically. This design approach is aligned with the notion of <a href='#self-describing'>self-describing resources</a> in that applications are only required to identify a particular relation indicating the inbox location, and perform a <cite><a href='#follow-your-nose'>follow your nose</a></cite> type of exploration. Given that a target\u2019s preferred inbox location may change at their discretion, applications can be adaptive in inbox discovery.</p>

                      <p>The data formats which are used by a notification specification must be chosen to maximise interoperability between implementations. <cite>Structure of Scholarly Information</cite> makes the argument for using <a href='#rdf-as-the-language'>RDF as the language</a> to express human- and machine-readable information on the Web. Allowing LDN actors \u2013 senders, receivers, and consumers \u2013 to handle data irrespective of the particular RDF serialisation permits flexibility, however it can also be costly to support. We take into account:</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li><em>Application interoperability</em> eg. should applications support all current RDF formats, as well as new versions or formats in the future?</li>
                        <li><em>Maintenance of RDF parsers and serialisation libraries</em> eg. will the RDF libraries that applications use be kept up to date?</li>
                        <li><em>Complexity of their inclusion in applications</em> eg. what are the costs or concerns of using all RDF formats?</li>
                        <li><em>Run-time efficiency</em> eg. how well will applications perform going forward?</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p><strong>Why JSON-LD</strong>: To address these issues, choosing a single RDF serialisation to <em>require</em> is necessary for consistent interoperability, as well as keeping processing requirements or external code dependencies minimal. While any RDF notation would satisfy that need, we decided that LDN requires all applications to create and understand the JSON-LD syntax, both for the contents of Inbox as well as for individual notifications.</p>

                      <p>To some extent, JSON-LD is compatible with existing JSON libraries or in some cases native programming language data structures. For example, Web browsers have a built-in interpreter for JavaScript that can handle JSON objects, that can take advantage of native object operations. Same data processing and manipulation operations are also available in a Node.js environment. Having said that, JSON-LD is a format that serves to be an RDF notation, and can also be processed as plain JSON. Hence, JSON-LD is just one convenience to certain kinds of environments that the application is confined to. JSON-LD is also advantageous in being familiar for developers who are <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='http://manu.sporny.org/2014/json-ld-origins-2/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190405035404/http://manu.sporny.org/2014/json-ld-origins-2/' data-versiondate='2019-04-05T03:54:04Z'>used to JSON-based APIs but not RDF</a></cite>.</p>

                      <p><strong>Content negotiation</strong>: Optionally, applications may attempt to exchange different RDF serialisations by performing <strong>content negotiation</strong>. As in compliance with HTTP principles, a sender may make an <code>HTTP OPTIONS</code> request to the receiver to determine the RDF content types accepted by the server. A receiver can expose <code>Accept-Post</code> headers for senders, and so the sender can serialize the notification in the request body accordingly. Consumers can send <code>Accept</code> headers to receivers to signal which RDF content types they prefer and capable of processing.</p>

                      <p>By mandating one RDF syntax (JSON-LD) for applications to communicate with, as well as permitting other syntaxes to discover and exchange notifications, compatibility across applications is assured.</p>

                      <p id='target-ownership'><strong>Target ownership</strong>: As per AWWW\u2019s <cite>URI Ownership</cite>, the Inbox is ultimately controlled by the owner of LDN Receiver, and subject to third-party access to HTTP headers and content. Hence, publishers of the resources advertising an Inbox (target) are expected to be aware of using servers they trust or control for the Inbox location.</p>

                      <p id='constraints'><strong>Constraints</strong>: One way to filter unwarranted notifications from being created on the server and exposed is where Inbox URLs announce their own constraints eg. <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212253/https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:53Z'>Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)</a></cite>, <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://shexspec.github.io/spec/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212253/https://shexspec.github.io/spec/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:53Z'>ShEx</a></cite>, Web Annotation Protocol, via an HTTP <code>Link</code> header or body of the resource with a <code>rel</code> value of <code>ldp:constrainedBy</code>. For example, an LDN receiver may want to allow notifications with a certain shape; a model specifying allowed and required values in a notification. This is so that senders can comply with the advertised constraint specification or the receiver may reject their notification. Rejecting notifications which do not match a specific pattern in their contents, or the <em>shape</em> of the data, is one way to filter. For example, if the Inbox owner knows that they will only ever use a consuming application which processes friend requests, they can configure their receiver to filter out anything that does not match the pattern for a friend request, helping their consumer to be more efficient. If the notification constraints are also advertised by the receiving service as structured descriptions, generation and consumption of the notifications can be further automated. Constraints are particularly useful towards providing notifications that meets a certain criteria so that it can be used effectively by consuming applications.</p>

                      <p id='authenticated-inboxes'><strong>Authenticated inboxes</strong>: The requirement for reusable notifications could be seen as a potential risk for privacy. The LDN Receivers are expected to consider implementing access control on the Inbox URL as well as the individual notification URL and may restrict reading and writing to a whitelist of trusted senders. Various authentication methods which could be used alongside LDN with the idea that notifications are not necessarily public but only visible or reusable by intended parties. The receivers decide (based on their use case) which consumers (based on any criteria) can reuse. They achieve this by setting authentication and authorization settings on the notifications. As  different authentication mechanisms are appropriate for different applications, the notification protocol should ideally be usable alongside various methods such as clientside certificates, eg. WebID+TLS, token-based, eg. OAuth 2.0, or digital signatures.</p>

                      <p id='personally-identifiable-information'><strong>Personally identifiable information</strong>: Notification payloads may contain any data including that which identifies the sender or the receiver. As access to the Inbox and notification data is under the control of the receiver, they ultimately determine what information may be exposed to the world. Once fetched by a third-party, any piece of information could potentially be subject to further (unauthorised) distribution and reuse. Hence, this is orthogonal to whether the notifications are ephemeral or persistent.</p>

                <h3 property='schema:name'>Test Suite and Implementation Reports</h3>
                <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                  <p>The W3C <q>Technical Reports</q> are intended to help different (current or future) implementations to have common core functionality and quality, comply with accessibility and internationalisation guidelines, and take security and privacy considerations into account. When an application, for instance, implements a specification, it can be checked against that specification\u2019s conformance criteria for normative requirements. Specifications are typically accompanied with test suites to assist implementations to identify their conformance level as well as areas for improvement. Similarly, reports and feedback help specifications to improve and advance towards publication. So, specifications and conforming implementations are integral to ensuring interoperable applications.</p>

                  <p>As a concrete example of the benefits of resource-centric notifications, I took the liberty to both use the W3C process of creating a test suite for LDN, and the submission of reports about implementations to exemplify the LDN protocol itself, as well as to generate discoverable Linked Data about the specification and its implementations. The LDN <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212253/https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:53Z'>test suite</a></cite> is itself an LDN implementation for the purpose of automating the collection and aggregation of implementation reports which were used directly towards the formal standardisation process.</p>

                  <p>The LDN test suite covers each requirement of the specification with individual tests, and the test suite documentation is semantically linked with the specification itself accordingly. Once the tests have been run, the test suite generates a similarly linked implementation report. This report is submitted using LDN itself as the notification mechanism. The listing of implementation reports (software conforming to the specification) is automatically updated and are accessible as their own registered units of information.</p>


                  <p id='ldn-test-suites'>The LDN test suite puts the LDN protocol into practice by acting as an LDN receiver implementation (based on <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://github.com/csarven/mayktso' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212253/https://github.com/csarven/mayktso' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:53Z'>mayktso</a></cite>). It also acts as a sender and consumer LDN implementation. Each part of the test suite (for <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/sender'>Senders</a>, <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/receiver'>Receivers</a>, and <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/consumer'>Consumers</a>) advertise an <code>ldp:inbox</code>. Upon completion of a run of the tests, the system generates the report data and sends an LDN notification to the Inbox. The payload of the notification is the full report as RDF.</p>

                  <p id='ldn-consumers'>As an LDN Consumer, the test suite generates the <a href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/summary'>summary</a> of the reports by fetching and processing Inbox contents. The notifications are aggregated automatically, and the semantics of the submitted reports are retained.</p>

                  <p>The services are decoupled; that is, an implementer may generate their report independently of the test suite, and submit it via the standard LDN protocol. Furthermore, projects can implement their own consumers and reuse the report data generated by the test suite directly, for example to demonstrate to potential users their conformance to the LDN specification.</p>

                  <p>All reports have their own URLs, and a human-readable representation in HTML+RDFa, in addition to JSON-LD or other RDF syntax per <code>HTTP OPTIONS</code> and <code>Accept-Post</code> negotiation at this particular test server. See for example <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://dokie.li/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212253/https://dokie.li/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:53Z'>dokieli</a></cite>\u2019s <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/reports/2c5af2f0-f832-11e6-a642-0dd857219753'>implementation report and test results</a> as a sender. This provides the human-visible information, eg. what was tested and the results also in machine-readable form. The report can be seen as a dataset composed of observations based on the structure that was specified in the specification. Hence, each test report is a <code>qb:DataSet</code> (and generally equivalent in <code>as:Object</code>) where its <code>qb:structure</code> refers to <code>https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/#data-structure-definition</code>. The dataset has <code>as:published</code> and <code>as:actor</code> for the agent that initiated the test and generated the report. The report may be accompanied with an additional <code>as:summary</code>. An example report at <a href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/reports/2c5af2f0-f832-11e6-a642-0dd857219753' class='highlight-observation-url'>https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/reports/2c5af2f0-f832-11e6-a642-0dd857219753</a> has the following core information:</p>

                      <p>Some of the sender implementations include streaming-capable implementations of LDN, stand-alone libraries, and domain specific applications. Some of the sender implementations also fulfill the role of a consumer. For instance, Linked Edit Rules checks the consistency of statistical datasets against structured constraints, and delivers the consistency report as a notification to the user. py-ldnlib is a library that can be reused by other applications to send LDN notifications.</p>

An LDN target (like a document or a researcher profile) with an inbox is the actor that affords the start of any communication. Applications consist of LDN implementations with one or more roles: sender, receiver, and consumer, with the purpose of delivering information to or about a target that can be used by interested parties.</dd>

                    <dt>Content</dt>
                    <dd>Target resources, inboxes, and notifications collectively comprise the content in LDN\u2019s flow. That is, any target resource advertising an inbox relation; an inbox description with a collection of notifications (with optional data about creating and using notifications), and individual notifications with any RDF contents. A notification\u2019s content can include or refer to any unit of information or communication in the scientific and scholarly system.</dd>

                    <dt>Accessibility</dt>
                    <dd>An inbox and its notifications are made <em>available</em> to users and applications via HTTP over a network connection. When an HTTP URL resolves, its contents are <em>retrievable</em>, subject to authentication and authorization. Content can be created by and made available to different kinds of consumers: humans or machines.</dd>

                    <dt>Applicability</dt>
                    <dd>Applicability of scholarly communication comes from research which responds to problems or answers questions, which can be used or built upon by others. Notifications enable communication between different parties (individuals, universities, research institutions, industry, etc.) and LDN enables more direct, non-centralised control over this communication.</dd>

                  <dl>
                    <dt>Registration</dt>
                    <dd>Prior to LDN, notifications generally would not be considered as persistent units of information. Notifications being registered as their own entities as HTTP URIs facilitates information discovery and reuse. Registration of scholarly artifacts are not addressed by LDN, however, notifications which reference scholarly artifacts are registered.</dd>

                    <dt>Awareness</dt>
                    <dd>The LDN protocol provides a way for content to be disseminated, as well as read by different consumers. LDN can be used to inform systems that a registration of a unit of information took place; a request for quality-control and verification is sought-after, or has occurred; and for instance, an archiving service is informed to place a request for preserving the units.</dd>

                    <dt>Certification</dt>
                    <dd>LDN can be implemented to support scholarly certification mechanisms. Notifications can be sent to request review, as well to return the results of a certification process such as a registered unit of information\u2019s significance and soundness. Units of information at any level of granularity can be referenced in notifications, from entire articles to individual data points. Similarly, information about a revocation of a unit of information can be circulated.</dd>

                    <dt>Archiving</dt>
                    <dd>LDN can be implemented to support archival processes. When new units of information are registered, or existing units of information are updated, archives can be notified in order to store a persistent copy of the resources.</dd>

                  <p>I have discussed how notifications may be purposed in a number of ways in a decentralised scholarly communication ecosystem. In addition, outlined specific use cases, and used these to derive design considerations. An overview of existing protocols for decentralised notifications indicates their respective strengths and shortcomings, and a new protocol is designed to meet our needs in light of this. The Linked Data Notifications protocol separates the concepts of <em>senders</em>, <em>receivers</em> and <em>consumers</em> of notifications for modularity and leverages Linked Data concepts of shared vocabularies and URIs, thus providing a building block for notifications between diverse decentralised and loosely coupled Web applications. The three roles can be implemented independently from each other or all together in one system. This permits end users more freedom to switch between the online tools they use, as well as generating greater value when notifications from different sources can be shared between applications and used in combination.</p>

                  <p>The utility and flexibility of LDN is demonstrated to some extent by the various implementations reported as part of the standardisation process. In this final concluding section, I evaluate LDN by comparing it along various axes with the potential alternatives. I also explain its relationship with other Web standards in the Linked Data or decentralisation space, and describe how LDN addresses users\u2019 degree of control over their data and applications. Finally, I discuss additional considerations that were omitted from LDN at the time of standardisation but may be important to take into account for certain implementations.</p>

                      </figure>

                      <p>All of the notification mechanisms specify multiple roles, with the Sender (S) being common across all of them. LDN is the only mechanism which describes the Consumer (C) role; this explicitly highlights how notifications can be useful to applications other than those concerned with sending and receiving. For mechanisms which include a Subscriber (U) role, the Receiver (R) is essentially also the Consumer, so Receivers are less generic and require specialised payloads. In this respect, LDN is a more modular specification. LDN Receivers need not be concerned with additional actions beyond storing and exposing notifications; complex and domain-specific uses of the notifications are left to Consumers, resulting in a lot more flexibility in terms of lightweight end-user applications.</p>

                      <p>WebSub differs in terms of the number of roles, but not the actual functions of the specified roles. The hub is an intermediate party which plays the role of a Receiver and a Sender, relaying notifications from the original Sender (or publisher) to the Subscriber (or ultimate Receiver), but nonetheless only makes notifications available to the Subscriber and no other applications.</p>

                      <p>LDN enforces that notifications should be reusable, and specifies how Receivers should make notifications available for Consumers. The other mechanisms either consider notification reuse as inapplicable or leave it optional and unspecified.</p>

                      <p>This is also tied to to persistence and retrievability in that LDN requires notifications to be identified by dereferenceable HTTP URIs. The other notification mechanisms treat notifications as ephemeral resources which only exist until they are delivered to a Receiver.</p>

                      <p>The mechanisms with the <em>fat ping</em> approach require structured data in XML or JSON-LD. Only LDN requires the use of RDF through JSON-LD, and optional content negotiation for other RDF syntaxes. Thus, notification payloads can include references to other retrievable resources, or can embed all relevant data directly in the payload.</p>

                      <p>Approaches which send only URLs (as with linkback) rely on the receiver interpreting a third-party resource, which may or may not contain structured content or be under the control of the sender. Approaches which offer additional guidance to aid the receiver in interpreting the source document(s) nonetheless still restrict the sender. LDN therefore offers flexibility to senders, increasing the potential uses for the notification mechanism. LDN compensates for increased complexity on the receiver\u2019s end by recommending filtering mechanisms, and moving most of the burden of understanding notification contents to the consumer role. In placing no constraints on the notification payload, LDN enables a sender to be precise and lossless with the data it is transmitting. As such LDN can cover a broader variety of use cases.</p>

                      <p>LDN recommends that Receiver applications perform some processing of the payload. This is to enable users to configure their Receivers to filter out spam or customise them for particular domains, but is not required; such filtering could also be left to or supplemented by Consumers. In contrast, Semantic Pingback and Webmention require receivers to parse the form-encoded payload and then to perform fetching of the URLs within and additional parsing of the documents those URLs identify. This is required in order to verify the message (by finding the target URL). Such processing in LDN is left at the discretion of the Receiver; linkback style verification is not required, but also not forbidden. </p>

                      <p>As WebSub requires subscribing as part of its core design, hubs are expected to perform specific actions on receipt of a <em>subscription</em> request (where the payload is tightly constrained), but not necessarily to process the contents of a notification sent by a <em>publisher</em> (where the payload can be anything; how they handle this depends on the content-type). </p>

                      <p>Though LDN does not specify a subscription mechanism in the same vein as WebSub, thanks to the modularity of specification conformance classes and the flexible nature of the notification contents, it is possible for applications to perform subscription-like interaction by taking on multiple roles.</p>

                      <p>LDN requires that Senders and Consumers are equipped to discover Inboxes (receiving endpoints) through both HTTP headers and the body of an RDF resource. This slightly increased complexity around Inbox discovery for Senders and Consumers is a worthwhile tradeoff to lower the bar for publishers of target resources; Inboxes can be advertised from <em>any</em> document on the Web (through HTTP headers), and attached to even non-informational resources (through RDF statements). This increases the potential use cases for LDN.</p>

                      <p>It is difficult to objectively measure performance metrics of different mechanisms as the various implementations use different servers and programming languages whose efficiency do not necessarily have any bearing on the protocols themselves. Mechanisms which require large payloads may increase the time for HTTP requests to be processed, and mechanisms that require verification add an additional network request to complete the process.</p>

                    <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                      <p>There are several technical specifications that LDN may be interoperably combined. Here I discuss a few.</p>

                      <p id='relationship-with-ldp'><strong>Relationship with Linked Data Platform</strong>: An LDN Receiver is not dependent on a complete implementation of the <abbr title='Linked Data Platform'>LDP</abbr> specification, but comprises an easy-to-implement subset. An LDN Inbox is comparable to an LDP <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsRelated' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/#dfn-linked-data-platform-basic-container' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212231/https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:31Z'>BasicContainer</a></cite>. LDP <a rel='cito:citesAsRelated' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/#ldpc-general'>does not define</a> how clients discover LDP Containers. Through LDN\u2019s inbox discovery, LDP Containers for the purpose of holding notifications can be discovered. Thus, the core features necessary to exchange notifications between LDN applications is effectively possible with existing, as well as future implementations of LDP.</p>

                      <p id='relationship-with-activitypub'><strong>Relationship with ActivityPub</strong>: ActivityPub uses LDN\u2019s <a rel='cito:citesAsRelated' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#inbox'>targeting</a> and <a rel='cito:citesAsRelated' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#delivery'>delivery</a> mechanism with <a rel='cito:citesAsRelated' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#ldn-relationship'>some specific constraints</a>. Notifications must use a single AS2 Activity in compact JSON-LD syntax. Receivers are required to authenticate requests made by Senders, as well as verify the existence of an object (that the activity is about) that is mentioned in the notification by fetching its source from the origin server. It is possible for LDN Senders to deliver notifications to AP servers. It is also possible for AP clients to deliver messages to LDN Receivers with some bridging.</p>

                      <p id='relationship-with-fedora'><strong>Relationship with Fedora API</strong>: The <a rel='cito:citesAsRelated' href='http://fcrepo.github.io/fcrepo-specification/'>Fedora API Specification</a> is in the process of being formalised (as an extension of LDP) by the Fedora community. As LDN can be used to support external integrations, Fedora API\u2019s repository event stream <a rel='cito:citesAsRelated' href='https://fcrepo.github.io/fcrepo-specification/#notifications'>draws upon the LDN specification</a>, allowing LDN consumers and senders to react asynchronously to repository events. Fedora implementations were included in the LDN implementation reports.</p>

                      <p id='linked-data-vocabularies'><strong>Linked Data vocabularies</strong>: As LDN is agnostic about the contents of a notification, any Linked Data vocabulary can be used, including the <cite><a href='#vocabularies'>Vocabularies</a></cite> I have previously discussed in <cite><a href='#structure-of-scholarly-information'>Structure of Scholarly Information</a></cite>.</p>

                      <p id='federation-protocols'><strong>Relationship with other federation protocols</strong>: Further similarities and differences between LDN and other federation protocols and social APIs are described in W3C Note <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/social-web-protocols/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212256/https://www.w3.org/TR/social-web-protocols/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:56Z'>Social Web Protocols</a></cite>.

                      <p>At the beginning of this section, four requirements relating to <cite><a href='#degree-of-control'>Degree of Control</a></cite> were listed. LDN addresses each of these as follows:</p>

                      <dl>
                        <dt>Actors can use their preferred applications to discover, reuse, and send notifications</dt>
                        <dd>LDN was developed as a W3C standard, with strict criteria for interoperability. Applications which implement any of the roles of the protocol can confirm their conformance with the test suite, and are thus expected to be able to interoperate with other conformant applications. Actors should be able to choose any available conformant application and maintain expected notification-related functionality.</dd>

                        <dt>Users store incoming notifications where they prefer</dt>
                        <dd>Any conforming LDN Receiver (server) under a particular user\u2019s control \u2013 which they trust, and are authorised to read \u2013 can be chosen to store notifications.</dd>

                        <dd>LDN specifies the mechanism for information exchange, so it is possible to switch between Receiver applications at the protocol level without any further action (implementation-specific details like database storage mechanism may require additional work for portability of data already stored there; this is out of scope of the LDN specification). A user\u2019s Receiver, where notification data is stored, has no bearing on their ability to alternate between sending and consuming applications as needed.</dd>

                        <dd>Users can serve their inbox and the notifications from different HTTP URIs provided that they do not mind persistence. In this case, the target resource\u2019s inbox location would simply point to the new location. As inbox discovery starts from looking up a target resource\u2019s description, the new inbox location will be discovered as before.</dd>

                    </div>

                    <h4 property='schema:name'>Additional Considerations</h4>
                    <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                      <p>The LDN specification itself covers privacy and security considerations on <cite><a href='#authenticated-inboxes'>authenticated inboxes</a></cite> and <cite><a href='#personally-identifiable-information'>personally identifiable information</a></cite>. As for <a href='#persistence-and-retrievability'>persistence and retrievability</a>, any consumer application can potentially benefit from being able to reuse notifications if the owners of a receiver makes the necessary commitments. There are further considerations which may be of interest to implementers, or may constitute future work around extending the core protocol, which are worth outlining here.</p>

                      <p id='subscribing-to-notifications'><strong>Subscribing to Notifications</strong>: The interaction between consumers and receivers describes a <em>pull</em> mechanism. A <cite><a href='#subscribing'>subscribing</a></cite> mechanism in which consumers <em>request</em> that receivers <em>push</em> content changes to them is left out of scope. Much of the related work <em>requires</em> notifications to be explicitly solicited to trigger sending. Since in a decentralised model, receivers may not be aware of possible sources for notifications, our sender-receiver relationship depends on the sender\u2019s autonomy to make such decisions by itself. This does not preclude the scenario in which a receiver may wish to solicit notifications from a particular sender, but as there are already <em>subscription</em> mechanisms in wide use on the Web eg. ActivityPub, WebSub, <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212256/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:56Z'>The WebSocket Protocol</a></cite> (<abbr title='The WebSocket Protocol'>RFC 6455</abbr>), <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8030' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212256/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8030' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:56Z'>Generic Event Delivery Using HTTP Push</a></cite> (<abbr title='Generic Event Delivery Using HTTP Push'>RFC 8030</abbr>), and can be interoperably combined with LDN, we do not need to specify it as part of our protocol. A push based interaction can still be arranged between LDN applications, where it would be implementation specific. For example, in a notification, a sender specifies the location of an inbox where it can receive updates about content changes. Then, an application that consumes the notifications manages its own subscriber list, and takes the role of sender in order to push content to the inbox as specified in the notification. Another specification-level integration of LDN pertaining to subscribing is that ActivityPub\u2019s <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#follow-activity-inbox' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212236/https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:36Z'>Follow Activity</a></cite> is a notification requesting to be notified of target\u2019s activities when they are created. Once the request is approved, the requesting actor is added to target actor\u2019s <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#followers' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212236/https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:36Z'>Followers Collection</a></cite> \u2013 a list of actors (with their own inboxes). The server then dispatches notifications to the inboxes of these actors.</p>

                      <p id='semantic-organisation-of-notifications'><strong>Semantic Organisation of Notifications</strong>: While LDN facilitates a decentralised architecture for notification exchange, it does not prescribe the structure and semantics of the notifications themselves. The composition of the notifications are unspecified to foster different kinds of applications to be built to communicate information in any domain. Consequently, organisation of notification models materialises through the fact that domain-centric applications create and consume what is meaningful to them in order to coordinate among themselves. So while the notification system is globally decentralised, it enables communication that can be specialised and be only useful and meaningful to applications that understands a particular message\u2019s semantics.</p>

                      <p id='inbox-paging'><strong>Inbox Paging</strong>: We need to consider both the needs of software systems and humans when large amounts of notification data are being generated and shared between diverse applications which may be operating without knowledge of each other. To organise and manage large amount of notifications over time, mechanisms should be in place to break representations of collections of notifications into multiple paged responses that may be easier to consume by applications.</p>

                      <p id='updating-and-deleting-notifications'><strong>Updating and Deleting Notifications</strong>: Receivers may want to carry out resource management or garbage collection, or permit consumers or other applications to do so. For example, an application to consume messages might let an authenticated and authorised user \u2018mark as read\u2019 by adding a triple to the inbox or notification contents.</p>

                      <p id='social-implications'><strong>Social Implications</strong>: In an ecosystem where anyone can (technically) say anything about anything, we can acknowledge the social challenges surrounding that in context of notifications. As the LDN protocol facilitates distribution and discovery of information, it can amplify misinformation and (community-centric) inappropriate content, as well as online and offline social dangers effectively. That is, consumers of notifications can be exposed to such information if an inbox is not managed properly. LDN may offer one way to mitigate this problem in that, the actors that control an inbox can decide on which notifications can persist and which to be removed, thereby one way to eliminate references to undesirable content created by other parties. At the same time, the same privilege can also be used to filter information and have bias towards certain parties. This is a form of decentralised curation in that while no single inbox can oversee the discovery of a resource (as there are alternative ways), it enables the owners of receivers to exert their authority on the notifications that makes it into their system. It is a middle-ground in that, on one hand, individuals can voice themselves by registering and making their resources accessible, owners of inboxes can choose not to provide pointers to it. I will further revisit some of these concerns in <cite><a href='#addressing-social-implications'>Addressing Social Implications</a></cite>.</p>

                  <p>As we have seen in <cite>Scholarly Communication on the Web</cite>, research communication is continuously transitioning from print-centric to Web-centric. LDN being rooted to Web-centric protocols and formats builds on a reliable and relevant foundation for it to be used as part of the future scholarly communications ecosystem.</p>

                  <p>There are many diverse use cases for notifications within scholarly communication now and likely to be more in the future, so designing the protocol to be flexible permits a common thread of data sharing between these different cases, as well as accommodating unexpected use. Specialisation may be necessary for notifications to be particularly useful in a lot of scenarios, however the protocol is not the level to do this. Thus, LDN leaves it up to applications to specialise their functionality for particular domains or user needs by using semantically <cite><a href='#self-describing'>self-descriptive</a></cite> notifications.</p>

                  <p>In the next section, I present LDN as one part of the broader scholarly communication ecosystem through an implementation which ties together many relevant protocols, and encompasses article authoring, annotations, and social interactions.</p>

                    <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                      <p>Today it would be difficult to think of a Web without social functions. Perhaps the Web\u2019s support and ability to facilitate social interactions \u2013 above anything else \u2013 contributed to the transformation of societies in the last quarter century. The Web, as a medium, expedited all patterns of social interrelationships in a manner that can be more efficiently documented, discovered and reused. It necessitates that system designs should be inclusive and facilitate <em>involvement</em> within the range of an actor\u2019s autonomy. Furthermore, actors should be able to use socially-aware decentralised applications that can perform the core functions in scholarly communications \u2013 registration, awareness, certification, and archiving.</p>

                      <p>The systems that are designed to fulfill the functions in scholarly communication should operate with the expectation of autonomous participation. One value that can be upheld through the principle of autonomy is to not have any constraints on where units of communication can exist on the Web. For instance, the actors of a system can have the freedom to designate identifiers to their artifacts: profile(s), articles, annotations, notifications, data, and so forth, as well as where they can be retrieved from. Similarly, the actor\u2019s autonomy to use preferred applications to interact with data. The <em>decentralisation</em> of the information space is <em>a</em> means to gain autonomy on the Web. With respect to <em>delocalisation</em>, units of information, eg. personal Web identifiers (WebID) controlled by their owners, can be used across different systems as they need not be tied to any particular URI space or system, and are free from external influences. Ultimately, autonomy is the right to freely choose and maintain sovereignty over URI ownership and data spaces, and the ability to use or switch between applications that can interact with them. Likewise, actors\u2019 autonomy would not obstruct them to use shared URI spaces if they so desire.</p>

                      <p>Any type of object, eg. scientific literature, research objects, personal websites, profiles and social graphs, can be made available on the Web provided that the <em>actors</em> have sufficient control over their URIs, or delegate to entities they trust. Through URI ownership, deconstructing and decoupling of resources can take place.</p>

                      <p>The contents of HTTP URLs may be logically centralised or decentralised. For example, the media representations found at the URL can embed compound or dynamic components that are dependent on external (remote) URLs. In this particular case, the persistence of the external URLs, as well as whether their contents are immutable is a design concern.</p>

                      <p>Autonomy is an important ingredient to fully exercise <em>freedom of expression</em>, which is a civil liberty. If a URI is governed by a third-party entity, ie. other than the researcher who shares the contents of a scientific resource, then it is possible that the URLs may no longer resolve, and the content may be subject to change in ways beyond researcher\u2019s control. Whereas without intermediaries, the researcher has sufficient access and control as to what happens at their URI space. This gives actors the ability to exercise <em>self-registration</em> with respect to the registration function. Trust in this case may be placed on the Web space that is closer to the owner and publisher of the URI.</p>

                      <p>The right to have <em>freedom of expression</em> necessitates that the articulation of scholarly contributions are not subject to arbitrary interference from third-parties, and allow actors to seek the most appropriate ways to co-create and co-participate. We inherit:</p>

                      <p id='freedom-of-expression-constraints'>Freedom of expression in context of academic communication does not entail that any arbitrary artifact eg. self-published articles, passes quality-control and certification from the community, or ethically appropriate. By free expression, I mean that actors should not be subject to <em>technical constraints</em> on how they communicate their discoveries and knowledge with the rest of the world. That is, to have the means to <em>shape</em> machine-readable structure and semantics, presentations, and interactions. Enrolling in the certification process of some literature can for instance mean that reviewers may engage in any aspect and granularity of the contribution itself, eg. a weakness for an argument in one literature can be contrasted (and linked) with a scientific result presented in another literature. Academic freedom to express entails that researchers caring out their work comply with discipline-specific methods and meet standards related to accuracy, precision, completeness, reliability, relevance, and so forth. Furthermore, as with human rights, the ability to express does not grant unethical practices at the expense of any person or group. Technical expressions that are harmful or discriminatory, eg. inaccessible content, constrained presentations, or undesirable user interactions, should be avoided.</p>

                      <p>The concerns about authenticity, persistence and permanence of data and knowledge is constant regardless of where the resources reside on the Web. Hence, strictly trusting scholarly knowledge based on its registered location is ultimately fragile in that it is unavoidable to prevent all sorts of threats to preservation in a long enough timeline. However, since the registration function is decoupled from archiving, we are able to delegate that trust to a third-party that is best fit to handle the preservation and to some extent guarantee the authenticity of the units of communication. This is particularly important as archival and trust are part of the global scholarly commons.</p>

                      <p>In context of the Web, technical or social decentralisation at all levels is unattainable. Even open Web standards are based on social and technical decisions, and can be seen as a form of centralisation in that conforming systems cluster and coordinate among themselves. Similarly, centralisation naturally occurs in social systems like concepts or language, eg. machine-readable vocabularies restrict the set of uses of a system. The alternative pushed to the extreme where each unit is expressed in their own language and without any language mapping, puts us in a situation similar to that of the <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212311/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:11Z'>Tower of Babel</a></cite>, ie. being incapable of understanding each other. Hence, autonomy in a system where researchers are isolated or information is not interpretable renders freedom of expression meaningless.</p>

A global freedom of information movement can be traced to the <cite>World Press Conference</cite> in 1893.

                      <p>The <abbr title='Architecture of the World Wide Web'>AWWW</abbr> states that agents, <em>interpret</em> available <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#dereference-details'>representation according to the data format specification that corresponds to the representation\u2019s Internet Media Type.</q> Here we can use the term <em>interpretation</em> in the general sense for both human and machine consumers of representations. An interpretation entails that a given content can be identified or discovered; comprehended in context of where and how it is used; as well being to put it to further use. Scientific and scholarly knowledge representations using information models that are based on Web standards brought through open consensus benefit from wide reuse.</p>

                      <p id='interoperability'><strong>Interoperability</strong>: In order to achieve cooperative systems, interoperable mechanisms are essential. One widely successful approach to have interoperable systems is through the adoption of open standards for protocols and languages that are arrived through open consensus. As per Linked Data design principles, this is accomplished with HTTP for communication, URI for identification, and RDF as language. While a decentralised system can enable each entity to be autonomous, some level of agreement is needed on the network for communication to take place. Systems that are interoperable by design have the benefit of interacting with other systems without having prior or out-of-band knowledge about them. This kind of interoperability can be contrasted with <em>post-facto</em> interoperability that is typically due to propriety designs at the discretion of each party, and then bridging the systems with application adapters and semantic mappings. In such cases, given two systems, one system adopts the others\u2019 protocol, API, or format, or they build specialised mechanisms in order to communicate. Systems that do not use open standards or have specialised technological extensions that are only useful within their own environment are generally considered to be vendor lock-in solutions. Here we seek agreements on Web standards established through open consensus, as opposed to independent and individual design choices made in application implementations.</p>

                      <p>Systems vary on their level of interoperability. For instance, a service may require their own user account or authentication mechanism to be used when interacting with data on the Web; users may have to use a particular application to access, create, share or reuse information; applications may need to be reconfigured to reuse the information that is created elsewhere. In the <cite><a href='#acid-test'>Acid Test</a></cite> section I propose criteria to self-assess accessibility and interoperability of artifacts in scholarly communication.</p>

                      <p>There is a balance between free expression of structure and semantics (through autonomy) and the degree of a communication (interoperability) that different parties can achieve. At the same time, as concentration or centralisation of ideas is ultimately inescapable, interoperability influences or limits the choices a system can take. Hence, we embrace the notion of interoperability as a trade-off, ie. it is better to seek and adapt design patterns that are expected or intended to be useful for the ecosystem. Hence, interoperability is a social construct with the intention of balancing autonomy and cooperative systems.</p>

                      <p>In order to have optimal means of discovery, exchanging, and reusing information, systems and data should opt for open standards and widely acknowledged best practices wherever possible. Linked Data technologies include some of the essentials to achieve this, and are well-suited to fulfill the four functions of scholarly communication on the Web.</p>

                      <p>Thus we refer to <q>universal access</q> in the widest sense that any agent; human, machine, or other can effectively access information and participate in interacting with different systems.</p>

It is intended to fulfill the <em>awareness</em> function of scientific communication.</p>

                      <p>It pursues this by accepting notifications <em>about</em> scholarly activities on the Web, making them available for reuse, and generates an interactive visualisation for additional exploration. Consequently, LORC can assist researchers with their applications to discover pertinent scholarly information on the Web, and connect their knowledge with the global knowledge graph. For the wider scientific community, LORC can facilitate scientometrics studies and decision making based on the scholarly commons ecosystem.</p>

                    <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                      <p>To demonstrate the extensibility of units of communication within the frame of Linked Research, I extend the LDN <cite><a href='#test-suite-and-implementation-reports'>Test Suite and Implementation Reports</a></cite> and <cite><a href='#linked-data-notifications-implementations'>Implementations</a></cite> and describe the development of an interlinked, human- and machine-readable W3C Recommendation, its test suite, and implementation reports as a whole.</p>

                      <p>The missing connection among existing specifications and test reports is that a uniform resource discovery is not possible between the test reports and the individual conformance criteria in the specifications, where a given information at a particular URL is both human- and machine-processable (see <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsDataSource' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-specifications-reports#related-work' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212249/https://csarven.ca/linked-specifications-reports' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:49Z'>Linked Specifications, Test Suites, and Implementation Reports Related Work</a></cite>.)</p>

                      <p>Having the specifications and implementation reports interlinked and retrievable can facilitate their automated discovery and reuse. One use case is to be able to find applications that match a certain conformance criteria, eg. in order to have fine-grained bundling of software packages. While this would typically include "normative requirements", tests can potentially capture and reveal optional features of specifications. Prospective consumers of the compliance reports can be application developers finding appropriate software for use, as well as automatic software package managers.</p>

                      <p>The following figure <cite><a href='#figure-linked-specifications-reports'>Linked Specifications Reports</a></cite> depicts an overview of linking the LDN specification, its test suite, the generated implementation report for the dokieli project, reports summary, and an article citing the specification.</p>

                      <p>The information patterns in the LDN <a href='#a-decentralised-notifications-protocol'>specification</a> and the <a href='#test-suite-and-implementation-reports'>implementation reports</a> sections are reusable across other specifications and related components. Sources are available from:</p>

                      <p>The notifications carrying the reports have an HTML+RDFa representation (alternatively in other RDF serialisations upon content negotiation). The scholarly article on <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212249/https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:49Z'>Linked Data Notifications</a></cite> uses the <cite>CiTO</cite> vocabulary to cite the specification with <code>cito:citesAsAuthority</code>. Another peer reviewed article, <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/dokieli-rww' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212314/https://csarven.ca/dokieli-rww' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:14Z'>Decentralised Authoring, Annotations and Notifications for a Read-Write Web with dokieli</a></cite>, contextually cites the specification with <code>cito:citesAsPotentialSolution</code> from its <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/dokieli-rww#architectural-overview'>architectural overview</a> section, as well as the LDN Test Suite with <code>cito:citesAsAuthority</code> from its <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/dokieli-rww#adoption'>adoption</a> section.

                  <p>There is an abundance of scientific information on the Web. However, humans and machines have restricted access, are required to pay, or hindered to efficiently discover relations. The knowledge industry can better address societal challenges by embracing the virtues of the Web via decentralisation and interconnectivity of our collective knowledge.</p>

                  <p id='mirroring-the-web'><strong>Mirroring the Web</strong>: LR is an initiative to strive to experience the full effects of the Web by observing and making use of its affordances. LR serves as a conceptual framework that describes how actors can control their interactions and data, make use of human- and machine-readable information through Web-interfaces, as well as how decentralised and socially-aware applications can exchange information on route to fulfilling the core functions of scholarly communication.</p>

                  <p id='traps'><strong>Traps</strong>: Are there ideological and technology traps in LR? The traps can be seen as analogous to McLuhan\u2019s <cite><a href='#effect-reverses-into'>Reverses Into</a></cite> effect. When the LR design principles are "pushed to the extreme", highly specialised and fine-grained centralised systems may emerge while still operating within the larger decentralised system on the Web. The degree of interoperability among the autonomous systems will vary. The artifacts may be controlled or managed by a new generation of entities in information spaces, eg. agents delegated to perform certain operations on behalf of an actor. Just as centralised publishing and distribution services currently exist for the dominating print-centric industry, the medium can still accommodate similar control over semantic and granular scientific resources. Individual autonomy without cooperation among the actors can make it difficult to establish and maintain trust.</p>

                  <p id='reconfiguring-forces-and-functions'><strong>Reconfiguring Forces and Functions</strong>: The existing or prior models for information exchange that has been described so far primarily focus on institutional or subject repository driven scholarly communication. They inherently require the involvement of third-party service providers \u2013 for- or non-profit \u2013 which impose a particular arrangement of the coupling of the scholarly information space per <em>forces and functions</em>. For instance, traditional journals most commonly couple the registration and certification functions, whereas the configuration based on LR allows different actors to activate different functions on demand.</p>

                  <p id='basic-costs'><strong>Basic Costs</strong>: From the perspective of an actor, the costs for a personal domain name along with data storage can be in the range of 100 USD per year with sufficient space for common Web publishing \u2013 "unlimited" amount of registration of units of communication and publishing any hypermedia. As for archiving services, it would be typically handled by "external" stakeholders with respect to the actor sharing their registered content.</p>

                  <p id='social-barriers'><strong>Social Barriers</strong>: At this time, promotion and tenure are integral to the academic profession. The incentives in the academic profession predominantly relies on an ecosystem that is largely led by third-party publishers and services. LR can be seen as market driven from the perspective of self-driven actors in the system \u2013 similar to proponents of the preprint movement.</p>

                  <p>With the arrival and the adoption of the Web by the masses, a <q>paradigm shift</q> \u2013 from print to electric \u2013 had occurred. Sociotechnical advancements in the past three decades in context of the Web serves as an evidence of the shift towards using the Web as a primary environment (medium) for "normal" scholarly communication. Put into historical perspective, we are indeed operating in the early phase of this new paradigm. Thus, I content that all advancements \u2013 no matter how radical they appear or claim to be \u2013 still operate within the framework of the Web, regardless of content shaped as if for print, being accessible to the privileged, controlled by third-party entities, and so forth.</p>

                  <p>I will use Kuhn\u2019s five characteristics \u2013 <q><a href='#paradigm-characteristics'>accuracy, consistency, scope, simplicity, and fruitfulness</a></q> from <cite><a href='#objectivity-value-judgment-and-theory-choice'>Objectivity, Value Judgment, and Theory Choice</a></cite> \u2013 to measure the quality of <cite>Linked Research</cite> as a shared <em>sub-</em>paradigm for scholarly communication on the Web. The criteria is not intended to be exhaustive but, rather, used to cover varied aspects to situate LR. I provide these descriptions for the purpose of assisting <cite><a href='#stakeholders'>stakeholders</a></cite> gain a perspective on LR\u2019s values, facilitate determining its adequacy for use, as well as to evaluate LR against other models.</p>

                  <p>LR is based on the notion that the Web is inherently decentralised, social, and for everyone. Its design principles shapes data and systems to be built on open Web standards to carry out scholarly activities.</p>

                  <p id='paradigm-accuracy'><strong>Accuracy</strong>: LR is based on the core mechanisms for identification, interaction, and representation of units of information on the Web. For instance, <cite><a href='#semantic-citations'>semantic citations</a></cite> enables actors to build precise and contextual relations between atomic units, preserve author\u2019s intentions at the time of citing, create a snapshot of the target while citing, as well as announce the citation activity. Thus, the creation, dissemination, and discovery of typed citations (as opposed to generic citations), brings forth an accurate representation of a network of shared knowledge. In this respect, LR is empirically adequate within the frame of what Linked Data vocabularies can potentially express irrespective of where the cited entities are located on the Web.</p>

                  <p id='paradigm-consistency'><strong>Consistency</strong>: LR is consistent within itself as per the alignment with the <cite><a href='#architecture-of-the-web'>Architecture of the Web</a></cite> and using open Web standards (in contrast to print-centric approaches on the Web). LR adopts the notion of actors having free and unrestricted access to knowledge, and thus consistent with several community principles and initiatives with the same goal, eg. the Open Access movement, self-archiving of literature so that it is readable by anyone for free, Semantic Web publishing. In this respect, LR is a continuation or aligned with the theme to democratise knowledge through the use of the Web. On the other hand, with respect to the common social practices around "publishing", LR is explicit about actors (content creators) ultimately deciding how to make their contributions. Hence, LR is inconsistent with the existing practice or market-driven notion of requiring actors to use particular third-party services in order to participate in scientific and knowledge exchange, as well as the way in which contributions are acknowledged by relevant stakeholders. From this perspective, LR\u2019s notion of an "actor" can be interpreted to be <em>incommensurable</em> with the "actor" in the contemporary scholarly system. Furthermore, LR is currently a technology driven change as opposed to market driven change in that the added value comes from a way to reconfigure the interplay of forces and functions. However, it is not a paradigmatic change in terms of strategic repositioning and development of the forces and functions eg. who can ultimately be an actor and their potential competences.</p>

                  <p id='paradigm-scope'><strong>Scope</strong>: LR has broad scope in that knowledge can be incrementally connected and extended (at any time) by using shared identifiers for units of communication and compatible data models. Through the use of languages like RDF, information discovery mechanism remains uniform.</p>

                  <p id='paradigm-simplicity'><strong>Simplicity</strong>: LR is a "lossless" approach to representing and sharing information on the Web in that the content can be registered independently from its presentation and behaviour, thus making it possible to refer and connect units of communication at any level of abstraction. As machine-readable representation is encoded through the serialisation of the RDF language, the underlying information can be transformed into alternative serialisations without compromising its integrity. The Open Web Platform makes it possible to treat and handle content "as is" without requiring supplemental protocols, proprietary plug-ins, or external tools to create and share content.</p>

                  <p id='paradigm-fruitfulness'><strong>Fruitfulness</strong>: Machine-readable information facilitates discovery and reuse of units of communication. As in the case of semantic citations, LR opens up the possibility to create as well as detect precise relations which were previously unnoted or disclosed through appropriate interoperable standards. Units of communication in the form of a knowledge graph being machine-identifiable and queryable has the affordance to detect or inspect patterns. For instance, open research questions can be found by analysing semantically structured literature, as well as detecting topical trends in research communities. LR\u2019s design principles enables the use of existing and future open Web standards. Its continuous interoperability would permit LR to be evolvable.</p>

                  <p>Whether to use the LR model will depend on the "value judgment" of stakeholders and the research community. LR is merely a reflection of using the Web to its full potential for scholarly communication. LR in and itself is not a new paradigm, but rather a conceptual specification that can be used as an <em>exemplar</em> reflecting the technical advancements.</p>

                      <p>To demonstrate the extensibility of units of communication within the frame of Linked Research, I extend the LDN <cite><a href='#test-suite-and-implementation-reports'>Test Suite and Implementation Reports</a></cite> and <cite><a href='#linked-data-notifications-implementations'>Implementations</a></cite> and describe the development of an interlinked, human- and machine-readable W3C Recommendation, its test suite, and implementation reports as a whole.</p>

                      <p>The missing connection among existing specifications and test reports is that a uniform resource discovery is not possible between the test reports and the individual conformance criteria in the specifications, where a given information at a particular URL is both human- and machine-processable (see <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsDataSource' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-specifications-reports#related-work' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212249/https://csarven.ca/linked-specifications-reports' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:49Z'>Linked Specifications, Test Suites, and Implementation Reports Related Work</a></cite>.)</p>

                      <p>Having the specifications and implementation reports interlinked and retrievable can facilitate their automated discovery and reuse. One use case is to be able to find applications that match a certain conformance criteria, eg. in order to have fine-grained bundling of software packages. While this would typically include "normative requirements", tests can potentially capture and reveal optional features of specifications. Prospective consumers of the compliance reports can be application developers finding appropriate software for use, as well as automatic software package managers.</p>

                      <p>The notifications carrying the reports have an HTML+RDFa representation (alternatively in other RDF serialisations upon content negotiation). The scholarly article on <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212249/https://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:49Z'>Linked Data Notifications</a></cite> uses the <cite>CiTO</cite> vocabulary to cite the specification with <code>cito:citesAsAuthority</code>.

The system demonstrating the mechanism stores the analysis in RDF to enable future discovery and reuse eg. researchers looking up statistically significant results based on a set of indicators for a specific reference area. As a result, distributed linked statistics with accompanying provenance data can be more easily explored and analysed by interested parties.</p>\n\n                      <p>The approach expects that the data is modelled using the RDF Data Cube vocabulary and has <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/#wf' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212226/http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:26Z'>Well-formed cubes</a></cite>. Essential checks for integrity constraints include: 1) a unique data structure definition (DSD) is used for a dataset, 2) the DSD includes a measure (value of each observation), 3) concept dimensions have code lists, and 4) codes are from the code lists.</p>\n\n                      <p>In order to compare variables in observations across statistical datasets, there needs to be an agreement on the concepts that are being matched for in respective observations. In the case of regression analysis, the primary concern is about reference areas (ie. locations), and making sure that the comparison made for the observations from dataset<sub>x</sub> (independent variable) and dataset<sub>y</sub> (dependent variable) are using concepts that are interlinked (using the property <code>skos:exactMatch</code>). Practically, a concept eg. Switzerland, from at least one of the dataset\u2019s code lists should have a relation to the other dataset\u2019s concept. It ensures that there is a reliable degree of confidence that the particular concept is interchangeable or the degree in which the concepts being comparable. Hence, the measure corresponding to the phenomenon being observed, is about the same location in both datasets. To this end, concepts in the datasets were interlinked.</p>\n\n                      <p>In order to foster trust and confidence for data consumers (human and machine), the analysis is accompanied with provenance data. The analysis includes a <cite><a rel='cito:usesConclusionsFrom' href='https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/UI#OhYeah' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212226/https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/UI' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:26Z'>Oh yeah?</a></cite> reference (in HTML as well as in RDF serializations) intended to guide the data consumer to a resource about the provenance activity \u2013 using the PROV-O vocabulary \u2013 about the performed analysis. These previously generated provenance activities provide links to all data sources which were used for the analysis, query construct for data aggregation, as well as metadata about the used tools, assigned license, production timestamps, and responsible agents for the generated analysis. Thus, in addition to analysis metadata, the user is able to track the data all the way back to its origins (at the statistical agencies), and reproduce or compare their results.</p>\n\n                      <p>The proposed approach focuses on the scalability of the system with minimal human intervention. That is, new statistical dataset can be independently published while being expressed with relevant statistical vocabularies, and sufficient interlinks between concepts, then applications can discover them and perform queries in a uniform way. Hence, applications <em>only</em> need to be made aware of the location of new datasets.</p>\n                    "^^rdf:HTML;

                    <div property='schema:description' datatype='rdf:HTML'>
                      <p>In <cite><a rel='cito:usesConclusionsFrom' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-statistical-data-analysis' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212225/https://csarven.ca/linked-statistical-data-analysis' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:25Z'>Linked Statistical Data Analysis</a></cite>, Capadisli, 2013, puts forward an approach based on decentralised (and federated) structured queries to retrieve statistical data from various SPARQL endpoints, conducting various data analyses (eg. regression analysis), and providing the results of the analysis as Linked Data back to the user. The system demonstrating the mechanism stores the analysis in RDF to enable future discovery and reuse eg. researchers looking up statistically significant results based on a set of indicators for a specific reference area. As a result, distributed linked statistics with accompanying provenance data can be more easily explored and analysed by interested parties.</p>

                      <p>The approach expects that the data is modelled using the RDF Data Cube vocabulary and has <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/#wf' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212226/http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:26Z'>Well-formed cubes</a></cite>. Essential checks for integrity constraints include: 1) a unique data structure definition (DSD) is used for a dataset, 2) the DSD includes a measure (value of each observation), 3) concept dimensions have code lists, and 4) codes are from the code lists.</p>

                      <p>In order to compare variables in observations across statistical datasets, there needs to be an agreement on the concepts that are being matched for in respective observations. In the case of regression analysis, the primary concern is about reference areas (ie. locations), and making sure that the comparison made for the observations from dataset<sub>x</sub> (independent variable) and dataset<sub>y</sub> (dependent variable) are using concepts that are interlinked (using the property <code>skos:exactMatch</code>). Practically, a concept eg. Switzerland, from at least one of the dataset\u2019s code lists should have a relation to the other dataset\u2019s concept. It ensures that there is a reliable degree of confidence that the particular concept is interchangeable or the degree in which the concepts being comparable. Hence, the measure corresponding to the phenomenon being observed, is about the same location in both datasets. To this end, concepts in the datasets were interlinked.</p>

                      <p>In order to foster trust and confidence for data consumers (human and machine), the analysis is accompanied with provenance data. The analysis includes a <cite><a rel='cito:usesConclusionsFrom' href='https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/UI#OhYeah' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212226/https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/UI' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:26Z'>Oh yeah?</a></cite> reference (in HTML as well as in RDF serializations) intended to guide the data consumer to a resource about the provenance activity \u2013 using the PROV-O vocabulary \u2013 about the performed analysis. These previously generated provenance activities provide links to all data sources which were used for the analysis, query construct for data aggregation, as well as metadata about the used tools, assigned license, production timestamps, and responsible agents for the generated analysis. Thus, in addition to analysis metadata, the user is able to track the data all the way back to its origins (at the statistical agencies), and reproduce or compare their results.</p>

                      <p>The proposed approach focuses on the scalability of the system with minimal human intervention. That is, new statistical dataset can be independently published while being expressed with relevant statistical vocabularies, and sufficient interlinks between concepts, then applications can discover them and perform queries in a uniform way. Hence, applications <em>only</em> need to be made aware of the location of new datasets.</p>

        "\n                  <p>By using different arrangements of LDN, WA, AP, LDP mechanisms and as well as relevant Linked Data vocabularies, scholarly and social activities can be systematically created, linked, discovered, and reused for a variety of use cases. In this section, I present an overview of <em>a</em> decentralised information space including actor profiles, notifications, and annotations. As units of information are structured and semantically interconnected, it forms a knowledge graph with the following key components with respect to technical specifications and practices:</p>\n\n                  <ul>\n                    <li id='subject-annotation-service'>Assertion of preferred service for maintaining annotations about the subject resource (via <code>oa:annotationService</code>)</li>\n                    <li id='subject-inbox'>Assertion of a service for receiving and serving notifications about the subject resource (via <code>ldp:inbox</code>)</li>\n                    <li id='profile-storage'>Assertion of preferred storage location (via <code>pim:storage</code>)</li>\n                    <li id='profile-outbox'>Assertion of location of an actor\u2019s activities (via <code>as:outbox</code>)</li>\n                    <li id='profile-index'>Assertion of type index registrations (via <code>solid:publicTypeIndex</code>)</li>\n                    <li id='profile-knows-profile-storage'>Members of an actor\u2019s social graph (via eg. <code>foaf:knows</code>) asserting their preferred storage location</li>\n                    <li id='profile-knows-profile-outbox'>Members of an actor\u2019s social graph asserting the location of their activities</li>\n                    <li id='profile-knowns-profile-index'>Members of an actor\u2019s social graph asserting their type index registration (via <code>solid:publicTypeIndex</code>)</li>\n                    <li id='inbox-annotation-known'>Inbox or annotation service locations which are known prior to interaction eg. trusted or used by a community.</li>\n                    <li id='inbox-annotation-manual'>Inbox or annotation service locations which are manually input to the system eg. not publicised or private.</li>\n                  </ul>\n\n                  <p>When discussing discovery throughout this section, this means the <cite><a href='#follow-your-nose'>follow your nose</a></cite> approach of using the kinds of links listed above to find relevant services and other resources. Applications can incrementally arrange and implement a combination of these components to deliver and discover distributed activities on the Web \u2013 in a similar fashion to the <cite><a href='#paygo'>paygo</a></cite> approach. For example, the preferred locations for data storage, annotations and notifications for resources can be used as input to create new resources eg. assigning an inbox for an annotation where the inbox location is derived from a profile\u2019s preferred location for a class of information. Thereby a chain of operations can be orchestrated for decentralised units of information. This matches the notion of decoupled functions and reconstructing information flows for a unit of communication as posited in <cite><a href='#rethinking-scholarly-communication'>Rethinking Scholarly Communication</a></cite>.</p>\n\n                  <p>The following figure depicts a generalisation of a decentralised information space with emphasis on personal profiles, articles, annotations, and notifications.</p>\n\n                  <figure resource='#examplar-information-space' rel='schema:hasPart' id='examplar-information-space'>\n                    <object width='480' type='image/svg+xml' rel='schema:image' height='360' data='/media/images/articles/interplay-profiles-articles-annotations-notifications.svg'></object>\n\n                    <figcaption property='schema:name'>Interplay of Profiles, Articles, Annotations, and Notifications.</figcaption>\n                  </figure>\n                "^^rdf:HTML;

                      </ol>

                      <p id='acoustic-age'><strong>Acoustic age</strong>: According to McLuhan, the acoustic world depended on speech and hearing for communication. Information was an instantaneous and simultaneous experience for speakers and listeners with a collective identity. Existence was about narrated events and survived through story-telling, songs, and poems.</p>

                      <p id='writing-age'><strong>Writing age</strong>: When the phonetic alphabet came along, information could be defined, classified, and referenced, as well as better preserved. The written word made human knowledge tangible, stretching itself across time and space. While the written word increased the need of our visual system, it brought along the acoustic world with it \u2013 early reading was still an oral, and by and large an external (social) activity, as opposed to internal in one\u2019s mind.</p>

                      <p id='print-age'><strong>Print age</strong>: Through the age of writing to the age of print, the phonetic alphabet transformed from being an audile-tactile experience to purely visual. Gutenberg\u2019s printing press (c. 1439 CE), through the process of mechanical mass production, had an extensive impact on the circulation of information, and triggered reconfiguration of societies\u2019 structures. Books have boundaries, uniformity, continuity, linearity, and repeatability; this had a profound influence on the organisation of social systems. Print further <q>detribalised</q> social organisations, enabling individualism, fragmentation, government centralism, and nationalism. As a work was mechanically copied, it maintained its consistency and accuracy in comparison to hand copied manuscripts. It was easier to transmit information without personal contact. Then came the responsibility for authors to be consistent with their definitive statements. In <cite><a rel='cito:obtainsBackgroundFrom' href='http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/174040346' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709103113/https://www.worldcat.org/title/connections/oclc/174040346' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:31:13Z'>Connections</a></cite>, 1978, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Burke_%28science_historian%29'>Burke</a>, posits that once a piece of knowledge was publicly shared, its creator was identifiable and received recognition. Print media democratised knowledge as soon as it became a commodity, mass produced and distributed to populations. The general public had a reason to not only access or acquire media like books, but also had a reason to learn to read for themselves, where previously it was necessary to go through a third-party; the wealthy, scholar, or theologian, in order to be informed. The increase in literacy consequently helped the public to be better knowledgeable about world matters without being subject to official or unofficial censorship. As there were more readers, the ability to write fostered the formulation and preservation of individual thought and culture, as well as enabling the public to voice themselves and question authority.

                      <p id='electronic-age'><strong>Electronic age</strong>: The electric <em>mass</em>-age made it possible to have instantaneous communication in different forms across the globe. Electronic media did not have the same kinds of boundaries that the print had on society and so society was able to re-organise itself differently. Unlike print media, electronic media like telephone, radio, and television, did not require literacy, and consequently the support of a stable education system. As a whole, it had the same effects on society as the acoustic space created in the tribal world. The speed of information increased, and with it recovered sociality and involvement which was previously abandoned as the primary mode of information exchange. Perhaps more interestingly, as the flow of information through various electronic media accelerated, it facilitated our natural tendency to recognise patterns and (ir)regularities in data \u2013 in comparison to print media which happened to isolate, classify, and immobilise items in fixed space.</p>

                      <p>Later I will revisit McLuhan\u2019s studies on the psychic and social consequences of technological innovation and apply them to scholarly communication on the Web.</p>

                        <dt>Accuracy</dt>

                      <p id='fruitful-science'>Kuhn reasoned that progress in science was not a mere line leading to truth, but the notion of moving away from less adequate concepts of and interactions with the world in favour of more <em>fruitful</em>. As to which paradigm can be objectively determined to be better, Kuhn argued that scientists\u2019 decision was ultimately inter-subjective and required value judgement because paradigms \u2013 the ideas and assertions within \u2013 were not necessarily directly comparable. For example, early versions of the heliocentric model proposed by Copernicus in <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentariolus' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709103110/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentariolus' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:31:10Z'>Commentariolus</a></cite> (1514), as well as the matured version in <cite xml:lang='la' lang='la'><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_revolutionibus_orbium_coelestium' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709103110/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_revolutionibus_orbium_coelestium' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:31:10Z'>De revolutionibus orbium coelestium</a></cite> (1543) was neither quantitatively or qualitatively more accurate than Ptolemy\u2019s <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_model' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709103111/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_model' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:31:11Z'>geocentric model</a></cite> (c. 2nd century CE) based on the knowledge and instruments available at the time. While they were equally internally consistent, geocentrism was regarded to be more consistent with the other accepted theories and doctrines in comparison. Copernicus\u2019 case however offered a simpler explanation and broader scope of application which ultimately was preferred. These were attractive characteristics for Kepler and Galileo when they came to investigate. With Newton\u2019s laws for motion and gravitation, the heliocentric model matured enough to set a new course for science and research.</p>

                      <p>Another example demonstrating the complexity of choosing a theory was from the perspective of language and communication. For instance, the term "mass" has radically different meanings in Newton\u2019s theory of gravity and Einstein\u2019s relativity theory because the definitions are isolated to their respective paradigms. However, General Relativity gave a new lens to understanding the interaction of mass in space-time. While the definition for mass changed, Einstein\u2019s theory was still able to precisely predict Newton\u2019s theory, and further provided an explanation for how gravity worked.</p>

                      <p>Contemporary scholarly communication is situated within a particular paradigm.

While the accomplishments of McLuhan and Kuhn had differences in methodology and structure, they reveal the overwhelming effects of patterns of change when new technologies and paradigms are adopted by society. These major communication shifts in society as a whole, and specifically in the mode of scientific inquiry, are rare and significant events in history. Content follows form; mediums and paradigms shape the space.</p>

                      <p>As the characteristics of the spoken word carried over to writing, and writing to print, print media also influenced electronic media like the Web and hypermedia.

For example, authoring tools help us to design and create electronic documents that resemble print representations even if they are not intended to be printed.

I believe that in order to push the boundaries of our knowledge further, it necessitates a multidisciplinary undertaking \u2013 taken <q cite='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_of_salt'>with a grain of salt</q>. One overarching goal is to foster the social machinery from different perspectives that is required to build a knowledge Web for any type of user; human, machine, or other. While I set the problem context to scholarly communication, applications of the knowledge and generated artifacts are potentially applicable to other initiatives in society.</p>\n\n                  <p id='assumptions'>I assume that researchers in scholarly communication are motivated to some extent personally, whether that is with the goal to take part in advancing collective knowledge, society and life, career advancement, prestige, or financial gain. Researchers are intrinsically interested in making their impact by way of sharing their findings in a manner that is most accessible to potential users. As for the underlying technical machinery for information exchange, I assume that it is useful to aim in designing interoperable information systems to help us address problems in context of societal goals. All of these aspects are part of the <q cite='http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/729965164'>social machine</q> of scholarly communication, and are explored through the sections.</p>\n\n                  <p id='up-next'>As many have argued, for scholarly communication to be more effective; accessible, usable, inclusive, as well as equitable, we need to adopt methods that are better at identifying and making use of the native affordances of the Web. This is particularly important today since academic and social activities use the Web as the primary medium to communicate (in contrast to systems that mimic paper media). Hence, I examine the core characteristics of the Web, discuss the state of affairs in scholarly communication, and share my findings on how a way to fulfill the forces and functions in scientific communication can be met by a socially-aware decentralised client application along with an ocean of open Web standards at its disposal.</p>\n                "^^rdf:HTML.

Gutenberg\u2019s printing press (c. 1439 CE), through the process of mechanical mass production, had an extensive impact on the circulation of information, and triggered reconfiguration of societies\u2019 structures. Books have boundaries, uniformity, continuity, linearity, and repeatability; this had a profound influence on the organisation of social systems. Print further <q>detribalised</q> social organisations, enabling individualism, fragmentation, government centralism, and nationalism. As a work was mechanically copied, it maintained its consistency and accuracy in comparison to hand copied manuscripts. It was easier to transmit information without personal contact. Then came the responsibility for authors to be consistent with their definitive statements.

Print media democratised knowledge as soon as it became a commodity, mass produced and distributed to populations. The general public had a reason to not only access or acquire media like books, but also had a reason to learn to read for themselves, where previously it was necessary to go through a third-party; the wealthy, scholar, or theologian, in order to be informed. The increase in literacy consequently helped the public to be better knowledgeable about world matters without being subject to official or unofficial censorship. As there were more readers, the ability to write fostered the formulation and preservation of individual thought and culture, as well as enabling the public to voice themselves and question authority.

Electronic media did not have the same kinds of boundaries that the print had on society and so society was able to re-organise itself differently. Unlike print media, electronic media like telephone, radio, and television, did not require literacy, and consequently the support of a stable education system. As a whole, it had the same effects on society as the acoustic space created in the tribal world. The speed of information increased, and with it recovered sociality and involvement which was previously abandoned as the primary mode of information exchange. Perhaps more interestingly, as the flow of information through various electronic media accelerated, it facilitated our natural tendency to recognise patterns and (ir)regularities in data \u2013 in comparison to print media which happened to isolate, classify, and immobilise items in fixed space.</p>\n\n                      <p>Later I will revisit McLuhan\u2019s studies on the psychic and social consequences of technological innovation and apply them to scholarly communication on the Web.</p>\n                    "^^rdf:HTML;

Kuhn contended that science did not progress linearly through history, rather it starts with a period that\u2019s disorganised, and then a paradigm \u2013 a collection of <em>exemplar</em> agreed by scientists on how problems are to be understood \u2013 develops to organise things for day-to-day <q>normal science</q> to take place under the governed paradigm.

                        <dt>Accuracy</dt>

                      <p id='fruitful-science'>Kuhn reasoned that progress in science was not a mere line leading to truth, but the notion of moving away from less adequate concepts of and interactions with the world in favour of more <em>fruitful</em>. As to which paradigm can be objectively determined to be better, Kuhn argued that scientists\u2019 decision was ultimately inter-subjective and required value judgement because paradigms \u2013 the ideas and assertions within \u2013 were not necessarily directly comparable. For example, early versions of the heliocentric model proposed by Copernicus in <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentariolus' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709103110/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentariolus' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:31:10Z'>Commentariolus</a></cite> (1514), as well as the matured version in <cite xml:lang='la' lang='la'><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_revolutionibus_orbium_coelestium' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709103110/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_revolutionibus_orbium_coelestium' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:31:10Z'>De revolutionibus orbium coelestium</a></cite> (1543) was neither quantitatively or qualitatively more accurate than Ptolemy\u2019s <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_model' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709103111/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_model' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:31:11Z'>geocentric model</a></cite> (c. 2nd century CE) based on the knowledge and instruments available at the time. While they were equally internally consistent, geocentrism was regarded to be more consistent with the other accepted theories and doctrines in comparison. Copernicus\u2019 case however offered a simpler explanation and broader scope of application which ultimately was preferred. These were attractive characteristics for Kepler and Galileo when they came to investigate. With Newton\u2019s laws for motion and gravitation, the heliocentric model matured enough to set a new course for science and research.</p>

                      <p>Another example demonstrating the complexity of choosing a theory was from the perspective of language and communication. For instance, the term "mass" has radically different meanings in Newton\u2019s theory of gravity and Einstein\u2019s relativity theory because the definitions are isolated to their respective paradigms. However, General Relativity gave a new lens to understanding the interaction of mass in space-time. While the definition for mass changed, Einstein\u2019s theory was still able to precisely predict Newton\u2019s theory, and further provided an explanation for how gravity worked.</p>

                      <p>Contemporary scholarly communication is situated within a particular paradigm. In <cite><a href='#linked-research-as-a-paradigm'>Linked Research as a Paradigm</a></cite> I will use Kuhn\u2019s theory of choosing paradigms as a heuristic device to <cite><a href='#contextualising-linked-research'>Contextualise Linked Research</a></cite>.</p>

                      <p id='oa-models-costs'>The foundations of the OA approach were conceived at a time when the major revenue models to cover publishing costs for scholarly literature were through subsidies from institutions, journal subscriptions, or pay-per-view. In this payment model, consumers of the literature were charged either individually or through institutions. In contrast, the <cite>article processing charge</cite> (<abbr title='Article Processing Charge'>APC</abbr>) model requires publication costs to be covered upfront, thereby waiving the costs for the consumers of the literature. Today, APC is the most widely used method to finance OA publishing, with varying levels of fees.

        "\n                  <p>Many systems which make use of notifications operate either in a completely centralised way, or are decentralised only in the sense that different instances of the <em>same</em> codebase need to interoperate; this review is restricted to mechanisms which do not expect the notification to be received or used only by the same software or platform which sent it.</p>\n\n                  <p>Existing decentralised notification mechanisms can be grouped according to the notification contents. Notification contents are either: 1) One or more URLs, indicating relations between Web resources (aka a \u2018thin ping\u2019), or 2) a \u2018fat ping\u2019 containing a blob of information. Semantic Pingback, Webmention, and Provenance Pingback follow the first form, and are also known as <cite>linkbacks</cite>, the suite of protocols that essentially allows Web documents to automatically reciprocate hyperlinks. This has the advantage that a verification mechanism can be tightly specified (the URL of the target must appear in the content of the source), but the disadvantage that notifications are generally suitable for website publishing. Fat pings, in contrast, are flexible and extensible in that payloads can be in any content type, carry any information, and be used for various use cases.</p>\n\n                  <p id='semantic-pingback-and-webmention'><cite><a rel='cito:citesAsRelated' href='https://aksw.github.io/SemanticPingback/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212249/https://aksw.github.io/SemanticPingback/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:49Z'>Semantic Pingback</a></cite> and <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsRelated' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212249/https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:49Z'>Webmention</a></cite> are protocols to send and receive notifications when a relationship is created, updated, or deleted between two URLs.

Resources which are the target for a notification advertise the respective receiving service or endpoint via a <code>Link</code> relation, either in HTTP headers or HTML. Semantic Pingback additionally enables discovery of the Pingback service where target description is available in RDF. While the content at source may indicate (in any convention or serialisation format) the type of relation between the source and target URLs, this information about the relation is not transmitted to the receiver\u2019s endpoint; only the source and target URLs are sent. As such, there is also no way to deterministically distinguish between multiple mentions of the target at the source based on the information in the mention. Hence, each receiver implementation is responsible for interpreting the underlying information at the source, thereby potentially inconsistent across implementations. In contrast, Semantic Pingback does encourage generation of additional semantics about the relation(s) between the source and the target by processing the source as RDF if possible, and also defines specific ways for a receiving server to handle incoming pingback data in order to add the source data to an RDF knowledge base. Beyond verifying that the source contains the URL of the target, Webmention does not specify any further requirements of the receiving server; nor is it expected that \u201cmentions\u201d are retrievable once they have been sent.</p>\n\n                  <p id='provenance-pingback'>A <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsRelated' href='http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-aq/#provenance-pingback' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212249/http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-aq/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:49Z'>Provenance Pingback</a></cite> endpoint is also advertised via the HTTP <code>Link</code> header; it accepts a list of URIs for provenance records describing uses of the resource.

        "\n                  <p>As knowledge builds on knowledge, it is vital to preserve the connection between units of information in scholarly communication.

In the most general sense, trust and accessibility are integral to preservation of content, integrity, and the context in which they are used.

The article focuses on practices that a publisher making a commitment to persistence by designing and managing the URI path and the content it resolves to, as well as the domain name it uses. The owner of a domain name has the obligation to define what the things mean for its URIs. This is also a form of social contract made by the authority that names and defines a URI to anyone that\u2019s using it \u2013 see also <cite><a rel='cito:obtainsBackgroundFrom' href='https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/PhilosophicalEngineering' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212245/https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/PhilosophicalEngineering' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:45Z'>Philosophical Engineering and Ownerhip of URIs</a></cite>.</p>\n\n                  <p id='persistence-policies'>Persistence policies can come in different forms.

These human-readable statements are useful institutional commitment to persistence. The ODRL vocabulary can be used in a similar way to provide a machine-readable policy about resources.</p>\n\n                  <p id='uri-social-agreement'>From the archiving perspective, Van de Sompel came to the conclusion that in a long enough timeline, HTTP URIs are not inherently persistent but persistable. The units of information that are registered using URIs are more of a promise made by its original or current authority. Hence, along with the examples from earlier, URI registration is ultimately a social agreement. URI owners declare a policy eg. implicit, written, verbal. If a policy is announced for a collection of URIs eg. what happens in 1000 years, then that says something about its intentions and expected level of availability. From this perspective, as discussed earlier in the <cite><a href='#registration-of-identifiers'>registration of identifiers with social contracts</a></cite>, <abbr title='Persistent Identifier'>PID</abbr>s such as DOI, PURL, w3id, and ORCID can help to prolong such promises and to extend the lifetime of accessibility of units of scholarly information.</p>\n\n                  <p id='decentralized-identifiers'><cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212245/https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:45Z'>Decentralized Identifiers</a></cite> (<abbr title='Decentralized Identifiers'>DID</abbr>) are identifiers for verifiable <q>self-sovereign</q> digital identity, where they are <q>under the control of the subject, independent from any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority.</q> In a way, DIDs go around the shortcomings of the domain name system where they can be created and managed without the authority of the registrar.</p>\n\n                  <p id='analyzing-the-persistence-of-referenced-web-resources-with-memento'>In <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.3459.pdf' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20180901151543/https://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.3459.pdf' data-versiondate='2018-09-01:15:15:43Z'>Analyzing the Persistence of Referenced Web Resources with Memento</a></cite>, Sanderson, 2011, presents the results of a study on the persistence and availability of Web resources cited from research articles in two scholarly repositories. The results show that within a few years of the URL being cited, 45% of the URLs referenced from arXiv still exist but are not preserved, and 28% of the resources referenced by articles in the UNT digital library have been lost. In order to address this commonly known as URIs ceasing to exist (link rot), authors suggest that repositories expose the links in the articles through an API so that Web crawlers can be used to archive.

However, the authors also state that such robust embedding in the infrastructure of the existing authoring, reviewing, and publishing workflow is still an open challenge. To that end, applying the <cite><a href='#robust-links'>Robust Links</a></cite> approach can help.

Alternatively, it may be that the content at that location is dynamic, and could differ from one request to another. In both cases, content drift creates a situation where if the originally referenced resource is still the same. From the perspective of Web-based scholarly publications, changes to content \u2013 accidental or intentional \u2013 can impact the degree of reproducibility, replicability, comparability of research results, and maintaining a reliable scholarly record.</p>\n\n                  <p id='persistent-identifiers-for-scholarly-assets-and-the-web'>In <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/9.1.331/362/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20180901160152/http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/9.1.331/362/' data-versiondate='2018-09-01T16:01:52Z'>Persistent Identifiers for Scholarly Assets and the Web: The Need for an Unambiguous Mapping</a></cite> Van de Sompel, 2014, posit that while PIDs are assigned to resources outside of information access protocols (like HTTP), there is a need to unambiguously bridge the discovery of the Web-oriented resource eg. from PID to HTTP URI, in a way that is machine-actionable. For example, the PID paradigm has the following discovery path:</p>\n\n                  <ol>\n                    <li>PID is the resource identifier eg. <samp>10.2218/ijdc.v9i1.320</samp></li>\n                    <li>HTTP-URI-PID is the resolving URI eg. <samp>https://doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v9i1.320</samp></li>\n                    <li>HTTP-URI-LAND is the redirect URI (landing page) eg. <samp>http://www.ijdc.net/article/view/9.1.331</samp></li>\n                    <li>HTTP-URI-LOC is the location URI of the content eg. <samp>http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/9.1.331/362/</samp></li>\n                  </ol>\n\n                  <p>Authors propose that using existing standards and practice, the essential ingredients for such a mapping is as follows. A PID has a Web equivalent HTTP-URI-PID, which is a requisite \u2013 minted by the naming authority. The HTTP-URI-PID can be content-negotiated to result in a) a human-readable representation at HTTP-URI-LAND or b) machine-readable representations with distinct HTTP-URI-MACH. The HTTP-URI-LAND remains the same for discovery, however, HTTP-URI-MACH uses an RDF-based approach to describe the aggregations of scholarly assets based on the OAI-ORE specification.</p>\n\n                  <p id='pid-uri-ownership'>It is worth briefly revisiting the notion of social agreements around Web resources.

The kind of mapping between a domain name and the IP address it points to is similar to a PID being mapped to a HTTP-URI-PID.

The <cite>Link Decoration</cite> approach decorates links in hypertext documents in order to be human- and machine-actionable. By additionally associating the datetime information when linking helps to retain such context. The datetime information can be accompanied with a snapshot of the target URI made at a Web archive or a versioning system when linking, and using either the original or the versioned resource as the primary reference. Including datetime information in the source document can make it possible to interpret the context of each of the links in the document and to discover relevant snapshots.

                  <p id='sociotechnical-advancement'><strong>Sociotechnical Advancement</strong>: Given our half a millennia of experience in mass print publishing, and half a century on electronic publishing, we are in a position to situate, examine and question our assumptions as to what constitutes scholarly knowledge exchange and participation in context of the Web. If research communication is predominately and increasingly driven by the Web, how can we approach the integration of scholarly processes with the inherent properties of the Web? One way to look at this is by <cite><a href='#the-printing-press-as-an-agent-of-change'>examining history</a></cite>: the printing press played a major role in moving the non-literate public to learn to read and write for themselves. Given the Web, we find ourselves in a similar situation with different modes of communication. For instance, the Web \u2013 an environment for simultaneous read and write operations on hypermedia \u2013 inherently enables anyone to be a publisher, where each actor can exercise their full creativity and ability to express the shape of their content. In order to use the Web effectively \u2013 as far as taking advantage of its built-in characteristics, the research community needs to better position itself to self-publish and disseminate their knowledge, as well as be more attributable and accountable in their social engagement. This kind of ongoing evolution is necessary for the advancement of research communication and consequently the society. Moving towards Web-centric information flow requires the scholarly ecosystem to unchain itself from antiquated practices and inadequate use of the available medium. In context of major communication shifts, we have not scratched the surface \u2013 30 years into the advent of the Web is still a brief period in history.</p>

To that end, future research can investigate how personal or community-controlled archiving services can be designed in order to enable decentralised client applications.</p>

                  <p id='linked-data-aware-user-agents'><strong>Linked Data-Aware User Agents</strong>: At the moment, common user agents like the Web browser are not natively equipped to parse and re-serialise data expressed with the RDF language, or have the ability to construct SPARQL queries and process query results, yet alone adapt the user interface based on content. Consequently, client applications and Web Extensions are forced to include (JavaScript) code libraries to handle these features until there is built-in support. Such method of inclusions increases the complexity of using as well as maintaining the libraries. Future research can investigate effective ways to natively integrate RDF and SPARQL libraries and support corresponding APIs in the Web browser so that client applications can focus on higher-level user intentions as opposed to lower-level data management.</p>

                      <p>Creating awareness and enabling actors to protect their data privacy is essential to fostering user\u2019s trust in the systems they use. The adoption of standards and practices with different <a href='#degree-of-control'>degree of control</a> can yield different privacy measures. In the decentralised and interoperable environment that dokieli operates in, there are a number of challenges and approaches. I discuss user privacy, data privacy, preferred proxy, and private activities below. The terms <q>anonymity</q>, <q>unlinkability</q>, <q>undetectability</q>, <q>unobservability</q>, and <q>pseudonymity</q> follow the definitions from <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='http://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.34.pdf' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190128120631/http://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.34.pdf' data-versiondate='2019-01-28T12:06:31Z'>A terminology for talking about privacy by data minimization: Anonymity, Unlinkability, Undetectability, Unobservability, Pseudonymity, and Identity Management</a></cite>, Pfitzmann, 2010.</p>

                      <p id='user-privacy'><strong>User Privacy</strong>: dokieli acts as a conduit to perform read-write operations against <abbr title='Personal Data Store'>PDS</abbr>. As the rules for read-write operations are set by servers, dokieli does not require the creation of user accounts at any server, in order to interact with the server\u2019s resources. Where applicable, actors can participate by maintaining their <em>anonymity</em>, <em>pseudonymity</em>, or can choose to identify themselves to dokieli by using their preferred <a href='#personal-identities'>personal identities</a>, without necessarily disclosing "real" information. Actors authenticate against the servers they prefer in order to perform access-controlled actions. It is possible for the environment in which dokieli operates in to transmit device, machine, or browser fingerprint, thereby potentially risking <em>unlinkability</em> \u2013 however, they are outside the control and scope of dokieli.</p>

                      <p id='data-privacy'><strong>Data Privacy</strong>: With respect to data privacy, actors can exercise their autonomy through the use of PDS for their profiles, articles, annotations, and notifications. As a <a href='#pds-expectation'>PDS can provide</a> us with the means to safeguard data, dokieli as a clientside application enables actors to perform <a href='#read-write-linked-data'>read-write Linked Data</a> operations where they prefer under their own conditions. With the help of access controls, a PDS that dokieli communicates with can potentially fulfill all minimizations \u2013 <q>anonymity</q>, <q>unlinkability</q>, <q>undetectability</q>, <q>unobservability</q>, <q>pseudonymity</q> \u2013 possibly with the exception of the domain name and IP that the PDS operates from.</p>

                      <p id='preferred-proxy'><strong>Preferred Proxy</strong>: A proxy acts as an intermediary between the clientside application and the destination server. This is useful in a number of scenarios for dokieli, such as getting around <a href='#mixed-content'>Mixed Content</a> issues, absence of <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212302/https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:02Z'>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</a></cite> (<abbr title='Cross-Origin Resource Sharing'>CORS</abbr>) support, as well as concealing the identity of the actor, fulfilling <em>anonymity</em>, <em>unlinkability</em>, <em>pseudonymity</em>, when making requests to a target server. An actor\u2019s preferred proxy can be determined by checking their WebID Profile description for the <code>solid:preferredProxy</code> relation, and if found, dokieli can use it to route requests when needed. Alternatively, a built-in (but user configurable) proxy location in dokieli is used.</p>

                      <p id='private-activities'><strong>Private Activities</strong>: The ability for actors to create and discover <a href='#activities'>activities</a> made within their social network without going through intermediaries, makes it possible to isolate units of information that is both access-controlled and invisible (or be unknown) to third-parties. These class of interactions in dokieli is aligned with the notion of <em>undetectability</em> and <em>unobservability</em>.</p>

As the medium revolutionised interactive publications, it was possible for peer review to be supplemented with online commentary as another form of quality control for scholarly literature at any state.</p>

                      <p id='function-of-peer-review'>The scientific community has been aware of the crude and fallibility of traditional peer review, for example, in cases such as, crediting bad research, good research getting dismissed for political reasons, <q>predatory publishing</q> (quality of the research content being irrelevant), or even treating commentary or opinion pieces as equivalent to scientific evaluation. <em>Nevertheless</em>, the function of peer review in the scholarly system is a form of self-regulation and certification. Without having any maintenance for quality, distinguishing valid, reliable, useful and ethical work from those not, would be difficult to achieve systematically. This is particularly concerning where the general public can become aware of a piece of information, yet the validity of the research findings may be inaccessible or absent, and thus have major consequences to our society and the planet \u2013 as with cases where widely agreed scientific evidence and observable effects of global climate change can be easily "questioned" by propaganda spread through mass-media by elite forces with a personal or private agenda; the amplification of the flat Earth conspiracy, and so on.</p>

                      <p id='reproducible-replicable'>Reproducible research findings refers to the notion that when the exact methods are used to replicate or repeat to reach the same findings. However, for some research, reproduction is not always possible, for example when data is sensitive, or influenced by time or space. In this case, replication can be carried out to answer the same research questions using similar or equivalent approaches. The reproduction of the original work can be either confirmatory, ie. able to reproduce, or; contradictory, unable to reproduce or inconclusive. Thus, in order to reconstruct how the data was generated and to make sense of it, data needs to be accompanied by enough detail about its provisional interpretations.</p>

It is considered to be limited in terms of capturing domain-specific knowledge. This is in contrast to using RDF as the language to communicate knowledge about arbitrary things at different levels of abstraction. Atomic statements about scientific information and scholarly activities can be expressed, as well as each component of a statement being universally identifiable. The language enables the information to be serialised using different syntaxes eg. HTML+RDFa, Turtle.

Essentially, interoperable information exchange and reuse by machines is intended to work over the RDF graph that is expressed and encoded with RDFa. Here HTML merely acts as the container to encapsulate the underlying information and to offer presentations and interactions (in regardless of the RDF syntax embedded in HTML). RDFa specifies only a syntax and allows independently defined specifications (like vocabularies) to be used. RDFa defines a single, non-domain-specific syntax, used alongside a hosting language\u2019s syntax, so that fragments of information can be consistently interpretable.

The following are a selection of open Web specifications; standards and practices that are designed with the notion of decentralisation, interoperability, and extensibility. They are based on use cases that facilitate discovery, read-write operations of interlinked Web resources.</p>

                  <p>Both Tramp and Sambra approach from the perspective that the Web has proven itself architecturally and universality, and argue to extend the decentralised architecture for information reuse and user interaction. The core approaches use the Linked Data technology stack for publishing, retrieval, and integration; decoupling services and applications from the users data so that content creators are owners and have desired rights on their data and its use; and fostering data extensibility and distribution, as well as privacy.</p>

                  <p id='internet-web-protocols'>The foundational communication and transfer protocols of the Internet and the Web are designed to operate in a decentralised and distributed manner. In terms of global functionality, removing a single node from the network \u2013 a machine with an IP address \u2013 does not halt the whole network. Similarly, when an HTTP URL is no longer available (eg. typical "404 Not Found", "410 Gone" status messages), the other URLs are not directly affected. This particular behaviour, where the Web being functional without requiring bi-directional hyperlinks is considered to be a "feature" (rather than a "bug") of the overall system. In the meantime, bi-directional links can still be established when so desired eg. as in the case with notifications.</p>

This is all meanwhile technically and legally enabling participants to retain their autonomy, identity and storage, access and rights over their contributions. In order to achieve this, one of the goals is to make an infrastructure where data and applications are decoupled by design. That is, an ability to work with Linked Data without constraints on which applications can be used, as long as they follow consensus-based open protocols and data models. At the core of this initiative is where users, groups, and applications use global identifiers (URIs), and  access control is applied using policies assigned to those identifiers. This also leads to the commodification of read-write data storage; the storage location on the Web can be decided by its owners and contributors, and it remains independent from the applications interacting with it.</p>

A Linked Data fragment is defined by three characteristics: data (what triples does it contain?), metadata (what do we know abut it?), controls (how to access more data?).

To this end, templating is where an HTTP operation is mapped to a certain URI pattern that a server executes a SPARQL command in order to drive RDF processing. When a client triggers a particular request pattern, the server gives a suitable response based on available templates that are identified with URIs. LDT allows arbitrary academic and research applications to be built while exposing a uniform API that can be used in decentralised environments.</p>

One common resource versioning pattern on the Web consists of generic URIs referring to the latest version of an accessible resource, as well as having a dedicated version URI for each resource. The Memento framework facilitates the discovery and retrieval of distributed versioned resources with datetime negotiation, a variant of content-negotiation; and TimeMaps an index of URIs referring to the prior states of a resource.

Depending on the one or more roles an actor has in the creation, editing, and republishing of content, the decision to create a new or reusing identifier is left as a judgement call.</p>\n\n                      <p>Here I discuss a few systems that pertain to registration of identifiers:</p>\n\n                      <p id='doi'><cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://doi.org/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190618082200/https://www.doi.org/' data-versiondate='2019-06-18T08:22:00Z'>Digital Object Identifier</a></cite> (<abbr title='Digital Object Identifier'>DOI</abbr>) is an international standard for document identification, and the services that are offered through <code>doi.org</code> is managed by the International DOI Foundation (at the time of this writing). The foundation permits <cite><a rel='cito:discusses' href='http://www.doi.org/registration_agencies.html' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190618080004/http://www.doi.org/registration_agencies.html' data-versiondate='2019-06-18T08:00:04Z'>DOI Registration Agencies</a></cite> to manage DOI records. In order to have a resource assigned with a DOI, it has to be done by one of the DOI registration agencies which requires organisational membership, excluding individuals. For example, a typical journal publisher as a member of a DOI registration agency (eg. <cite><a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://www.crossref.org/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190618081912/https://www.crossref.org/' data-versiondate='2019-06-18T08:19:12Z'>CrossRef</a></cite>) submits mappings for objects of interest. Given the statement in AWWW, <q><a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#URI-persistence'>URI persistence is a matter of policy and commitment on the part of the URI owner</a></q>, DOI introduces an additional layer of social contract to govern the discovery of research artifacts. A DOI is aimed at being a persistent identifier for an object it is assigned to, and has the mechanism to refer to the URL of an object where it can be found. That is, a DOI may refer to a landing page about the actual object and not necessarily the object itself \u2013 this happens to be a common practice for literature that is not necessarily open and free. For literature that has restricted access, the resolved DOI is typically a webpage where an actor would need to go through the system\u2019s <q>paywall</q> or <q>access toll</q> in order to retrieve the content. From a machine\u2019s perspective, what the DOI identifies at the resolved location is not clear eg. company logo, tracking software, search form or the intended research object? For open literature, the resolved DOI would generally hyperlink to the actual scientific object in human-interpretable only fashion, or be part of a webpage accompanied by material unrelated to the scientific object itself, ie. information that the scientists neither assembled as part of their research nor intended for the consumer. If the actual URL of the object changes, the DOI\u2019s lookup table for the URL has to be updated. Otherwise, they'll point to dead links or unrelated information.</p>\n\n                      <p id='orcid'><cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://orcid.org/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709111131/https://orcid.org/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T11:11:31Z'>Open Researcher and Contributor ID</a></cite> (<abbr title='Open Researcher and Contributor ID'>ORCID</abbr>) is a community-governed persistent identifier system for researchers and organisations.

PURL, w3id, ORCID, and DOI are PIDs. For digital objects accessible over the Internet, PIDs are intended to be used as a long-lasting reference to a unit of information, and be <em>actionable</em> in the sense that the environment can be directed to the identified source. For example, a DOI-based PID can be <samp>10.2218/ijdc.v9i1.320</samp>, and the organisation \u2013 in this case the International DOI Foundation \u2013 would be responsible to maintain an unambiguous mapping to an accessible resource. Typically once mapped, the process starts from a DOI URI <samp>https://doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v9i1.320</samp> which (currently) resolves to the location <samp>http://www.ijdc.net/article/view/9.1.331</samp> where its contents can be retrieved. URN, International Standard Book Number (<abbr title='International Standard Book Number'>ISBN</abbr>), Archival Resource Keys (<abbr title='Archival Resource Keys'>ARK</abbr>) are other examples of PID.</p>\n\n                      <p id='archives'>There are different forms of social contracts or <em>promises</em> made for long-term societal benefit in terms of archival and preservation of knowledge.

Such decoupling of application roles in context of a client\u2013server model permits interoperability between two classes of interactions, senders and receivers, or between consumers and receivers. These are atomic interactions in that they facilitate the design of loosely coupled systems that can exchange structured notifications as Linked Data. As such, the LDN protocol affords a high <cite><a href='#degree-of-control-in-ldn'>degree of control</a></cite> to actors in that they can use their preferred applications, store notifications where they prefer, switch between applications without relocating the notifications, and relocate the notifications without having to change applications. LDN\u2019s underlying mechanism triggers <em>registration</em>, fulfills <em>awareness</em>, and can support fulfilling the <em>certification</em> and <em>archiving</em> <cite><a href='#ldn-forces-functions'>functions in scientific communication</a></cite> in a decentralised ecosystem.</dd>\n\n                    <dt id='technical-research-problems-artifacts-review'>How can Web technologies be employed to fulfill the core functions of scholarly communication in an open and interoperable way?</dt>\n                    <dd>A decentralised client application based on the <cite>Open Web Platform</cite> can be devised to allow independent actors to exchange units of communication with decentralised storage services. <cite>dokieli</cite> demonstrates how an assembly of Web standards can come together in a cohesive way in order to enable actors to reach a high <cite><a href='#degree-of-control-in-dokieli'>degree of control</a></cite> over their creations and social activities. HTTP is used to perform CRUD operations, (HTTP) URIs to identify Web resources, and Linked Data design principles to uniformly represent, link, and discover information. Actors can identify themselves through WebID (HTTP URI) whether tied to a real or fictitious entity, extend their profile descriptions, and authenticate against servers with mechanisms like WebID-TLS and WebID-OIDC. Machine-interpretable profile descriptions also enables the client application to adapt to accommodate actor\u2019s capabilities. It is feasible to create and consume human- <em>and</em> machine-readable units of (scholarly) communication using standards such as RDFa in HTML, and be combined with other RDF serialisations based on technical specifications. A variety of Linked Data vocabularies can be used for semantic content authoring. The Linked Data Notifications protocol is used to exchange structured notifications. The Web Annotation Data Model and Protocol is used to associate resources and exchange annotations. The ActivityPub protocol is used to exchange social activities. The resources that dokieli generates are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable by other standards-compliant Linked Data applications. The resulting technical design operates under the notion of a scholarly ecosystem where applications are decoupled to fulfill the registration, awareness, certification, and archiving <cite><a href='#dokieli-forces-functions'>functions in scholarly communication</a></cite>.</dd>\n                  </dl>\n\n                  <p>In summary, Linked Data Notifications is a building block for diverse decentralised and loosely coupled Web applications to exchange notifications, and fulfills the <em>awareness</em> function in scholarly communication. dokieli demonstrates how <abbr title='Registration, Awareness, Certification, Archiving'>RACA</abbr>-aware Linked Data applications can be designed while fulfilling essential <cite><a href='#decentralised-web-publishing'>decentralised Web publishing</a></cite> requirements.</p>\n                "^^rdf:HTML;

Hence, if a server is capable of storing and serving resources in HTML, it will receive articles, annotations, and notifications in that form. Otherwise, dokieli will re-serialize the content into an alternative RDF syntax that the server prefers or is capable of handling per content-negotiation.</p>\n\n                      <aside id='http-patch-articles'>\n                        <p>As of this writing, the reasons to use <code>HTTP POST</code> and <code>HTTP PUT</code> over <code>HTTP PATCH</code>, for documents like articles, are as follows:</p>\n\n                        <ul>\n                          <li>Servers with <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5261' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212300/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5261' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:00Z'>XML Patch</a></cite> (<abbr title='XML Patch'>RFC 5261</abbr>) and mediatype <code>application/xml-patch+xml</code> \u2013 <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7351' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212300/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7351' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:00Z'>A Media Type for XML Patch Operations</a></cite> (<abbr title='A Media Type for XML Patch Operations'>RFC 7351</abbr>) \u2013  capability in the Linked Data ecosystem are not well supported.</li>\n\n                          <li>Servers implementing <code>HTTP PATCH</code> with <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212300/https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:00Z'>SPARQL Update</a></cite> (using mediatype <code>application/sparql-update</code>) would also need to re-serialize the content eventually as HTML+RDFa.</li>\n\n                          <li><code>HTTP PATCH</code> can help to optimise HTTP requests provided that the server processes the SPARQL query and eventually publishes the final state of the article. dokieli\u2019s use of <code>HTTP POST</code> and <code>HTTP PUT</code> on the other hand does not particularly expect or impose operations other than to eventually store and serve the resource.</li>\n\n                          <li><code>HTTP POST</code> and <code>HTTP PUT</code> are functionally valid. <code>HTTP PATCH</code> can still be used in the future if server implementations can better handle updates to documents encoded in HTML+RDFa.</li>\n                        </ul>\n                      </aside>\n\n                      <p id='mixed-content'>Due to <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/mixed-content/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212300/https://www.w3.org/TR/mixed-content/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:00Z'>Mixed Content</a></cite> implementations in Web browsers, ie. <q>fetching of content over unencrypted or unauthenticated connections in the context of an encrypted and authenticated document</q>, is subject to being blocked by the Web browser.

                        <p>Gutenberg had, in effect, made every man a reader. Today, Xerox and other forms of reprography tend to make every man a publisher. This massive reversal has, for one of its consequences, elitism. The nature of the mass production of uniform volumes certainly did not foster elites but rather habits of universal reading. Paradoxically, when there are many readers, the author can wield great private power, whereas small reading elites may exert large corporate power.</p>

                        <li>acoustic age (c. until 800 BCE); audile-tactile, preliterate tribal culture,</li>
                        <li>age of writing (c. 800 BCE to 1500 CE); audile/visual, manuscript culture,</li>
                        <li>age of print (c. 1500 to 1850 CE); visual, mechanical mass communication,</li>

                      </ol>

                      <p id='acoustic-age'><strong>Acoustic age</strong>: According to McLuhan, the acoustic world depended on speech and hearing for communication. Information was an instantaneous and simultaneous experience for speakers and listeners with a collective identity. Existence was about narrated events and survived through story-telling, songs, and poems.</p>

                      <p id='writing-age'><strong>Writing age</strong>: When the phonetic alphabet came along, information could be defined, classified, and referenced, as well as better preserved. The written word made human knowledge tangible, stretching itself across time and space. While the written word increased the need of our visual system, it brought along the acoustic world with it \u2013 early reading was still an oral, and by and large an external (social) activity, as opposed to internal in one\u2019s mind.</p>

                      <p id='print-age'><strong>Print age</strong>: Through the age of writing to the age of print, the phonetic alphabet transformed from being an audile-tactile experience to purely visual. Gutenberg\u2019s printing press (c. 1439 CE), through the process of mechanical mass production, had an extensive impact on the circulation of information, and triggered reconfiguration of societies\u2019 structures. Books have boundaries, uniformity, continuity, linearity, and repeatability; this had a profound influence on the organisation of social systems. Print further <q>detribalised</q> social organisations, enabling individualism, fragmentation, government centralism, and nationalism. As a work was mechanically copied, it maintained its consistency and accuracy in comparison to hand copied manuscripts. It was easier to transmit information without personal contact. Then came the responsibility for authors to be consistent with their definitive statements. In <cite><a rel='cito:obtainsBackgroundFrom' href='http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/174040346' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709103113/https://www.worldcat.org/title/connections/oclc/174040346' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:31:13Z'>Connections</a></cite>, 1978, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Burke_%28science_historian%29'>Burke</a>, posits that once a piece of knowledge was publicly shared, its creator was identifiable and received recognition. Print media democratised knowledge as soon as it became a commodity, mass produced and distributed to populations. The general public had a reason to not only access or acquire media like books, but also had a reason to learn to read for themselves, where previously it was necessary to go through a third-party; the wealthy, scholar, or theologian, in order to be informed. The increase in literacy consequently helped the public to be better knowledgeable about world matters without being subject to official or unofficial censorship. As there were more readers, the ability to write fostered the formulation and preservation of individual thought and culture, as well as enabling the public to voice themselves and question authority. In <cite><a rel='cito:obtainsBackgroundFrom' href='http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/611804138' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709103114/https://www.worldcat.org/title/printing-press-as-an-agent-of-change-communications-and-cultural-transformations-in-early-modern-europe-volumes-i-and-ii/oclc/611804138' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:31:14Z'>The Printing Press as an Agent of Change</a></cite>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Eisenstein'>Eisenstein</a>, 1979, contends that the print media also played a key role in facilitating scientific publishing and the scientific revolution.</p>

                      <p id='electronic-age'><strong>Electronic age</strong>: The electric <em>mass</em>-age made it possible to have instantaneous communication in different forms across the globe. Electronic media did not have the same kinds of boundaries that the print had on society and so society was able to re-organise itself differently. Unlike print media, electronic media like telephone, radio, and television, did not require literacy, and consequently the support of a stable education system. As a whole, it had the same effects on society as the acoustic space created in the tribal world. The speed of information increased, and with it recovered sociality and involvement which was previously abandoned as the primary mode of information exchange. Perhaps more interestingly, as the flow of information through various electronic media accelerated, it facilitated our natural tendency to recognise patterns and (ir)regularities in data \u2013 in comparison to print media which happened to isolate, classify, and immobilise items in fixed space.</p>

                      <p>Later I will revisit McLuhan\u2019s studies on the psychic and social consequences of technological innovation and apply them to scholarly communication on the Web.</p>

                  <p>Next, to continue to paint the historical backdrop against which this thesis is placed, I look at the European-centric scientific revolution which overlapped with the transition from the manuscript to the print-centric mode of information organisation and dissemination.</p>

Kuhn contended that science did not progress linearly through history, rather it starts with a period that\u2019s disorganised, and then a paradigm \u2013 a collection of <em>exemplar</em> agreed by scientists on how problems are to be understood \u2013 develops to organise things for day-to-day <q>normal science</q> to take place under the governed paradigm. After some time, <q>anomalies</q> in the paradigm accumulate and lead to a <q>crisis</q> phase where multiple competing paradigms attempt to resolve the issues. This is a particular point in which the community struggles to come to an agreement on the fittest way to practise future science. Finally a <q>paradigm shift</q> \u2013 revolution \u2013 refers to the last phase where transforming ideas and assertions mature enough to bring order to earlier anomalies, and cause a change in world view.</p>

                        <dt>Accuracy</dt>

                      <p id='fruitful-science'>Kuhn reasoned that progress in science was not a mere line leading to truth, but the notion of moving away from less adequate concepts of and interactions with the world in favour of more <em>fruitful</em>. As to which paradigm can be objectively determined to be better, Kuhn argued that scientists\u2019 decision was ultimately inter-subjective and required value judgement because paradigms \u2013 the ideas and assertions within \u2013 were not necessarily directly comparable. For example, early versions of the heliocentric model proposed by Copernicus in <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentariolus' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709103110/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentariolus' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:31:10Z'>Commentariolus</a></cite> (1514), as well as the matured version in <cite xml:lang='la' lang='la'><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_revolutionibus_orbium_coelestium' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709103110/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_revolutionibus_orbium_coelestium' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:31:10Z'>De revolutionibus orbium coelestium</a></cite> (1543) was neither quantitatively or qualitatively more accurate than Ptolemy\u2019s <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_model' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709103111/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_model' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:31:11Z'>geocentric model</a></cite> (c. 2nd century CE) based on the knowledge and instruments available at the time. While they were equally internally consistent, geocentrism was regarded to be more consistent with the other accepted theories and doctrines in comparison. Copernicus\u2019 case however offered a simpler explanation and broader scope of application which ultimately was preferred. These were attractive characteristics for Kepler and Galileo when they came to investigate. With Newton\u2019s laws for motion and gravitation, the heliocentric model matured enough to set a new course for science and research.</p>

                      <p>Another example demonstrating the complexity of choosing a theory was from the perspective of language and communication. For instance, the term "mass" has radically different meanings in Newton\u2019s theory of gravity and Einstein\u2019s relativity theory because the definitions are isolated to their respective paradigms. However, General Relativity gave a new lens to understanding the interaction of mass in space-time. While the definition for mass changed, Einstein\u2019s theory was still able to precisely predict Newton\u2019s theory, and further provided an explanation for how gravity worked.</p>

                      <p>Contemporary scholarly communication is situated within a particular paradigm.

While the accomplishments of McLuhan and Kuhn had differences in methodology and structure, they reveal the overwhelming effects of patterns of change when new technologies and paradigms are adopted by society. These major communication shifts in society as a whole, and specifically in the mode of scientific inquiry, are rare and significant events in history. Content follows form; mediums and paradigms shape the space.</p>

                      <p>As the characteristics of the spoken word carried over to writing, and writing to print, print media also influenced electronic media like the Web and hypermedia. Print\u2019s typography and knowledge organisation affects the standards, tools, and interfaces that are still used today to exchange knowledge on the Web, as well as certain social expectations or assumptions. For example, authoring tools help us to design and create electronic documents that resemble print representations even if they are not intended to be printed.

                          <p>The Web architecture permits agents to communicate through different protocols eg. HTTP, FTP, SMTP are application layer protocols in the <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105642/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:42Z'>Internet Protocol Suite</a></cite> (<abbr title='Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Application and Support'>RFC 1123</abbr>). In this thesis, the focus is on HTTP for data communication, ie. the structured requests and responses exchanged by Web agents. For example, when a <em>user-agent</em> (like a Web browser) initiates a request to access the contents of a resource identified by an HTTP URI (<em>dereferencing</em>), a server responds with a message body including a representation of the resource state, and data about the response. The content of the response URL (HTTP URI) is a particular state in that it has a presentation and controls (affordances) that can be further engaged with, eg. hyperlinks to follow; data forms that can be submitted; location of alternate representations. One particular description of this interaction is given in 2000 by Fielding, in <cite><a rel='cito:obtainsBackgroundFrom' href='http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105643/https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:43Z'>Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a></cite>, commonly referred to as <cite>Representational State Transfer</cite> (<abbr title='Representational State Transfer'>REST</abbr>): a set of architectural constraints for distributed hypermedia systems. There are diverse Web agents, eg. browsers, servers, autonomous scripts, with different capabilities, hence as per <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105642/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:42Z'>HTTP/1.1 Message Syntax and Routing</a></cite> (<abbr title='Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing'>RFC 7230</abbr>), not all agents are expected to make the same interactions that are presented to them.</p>

                          <p id='safe-interactions'>There are two categories of interactions: safe and unsafe. A <dfn>safe interaction</dfn> is one where the requested resource\u2019s state does not change. When an agent makes a retrieval request (<code>HTTP GET</code>), it has no obligation beyond dereferencing the URL. An <dfn>unsafe interaction</dfn> on the other hand may cause a resource to change its state, and that the user may be held accountable, depending on the semantics of the interaction. For example, an agent sending an <code>HTTP POST</code> request with a payload can get a response indicating that a new resource was created, that the resource represented by the URI was deleted by an <code>HTTP DELETE</code> request, or that the agent is unauthorised to either create or delete the resource.</p>

                          <p id='representations'>When a client requests a resource, the server may return a <em>particular</em> representation of a resource that is the result of a "negotiation" between them. For example, a client may indicate that it would accept the resource in HTML, Turtle, and JSON-LD data formats, and in English and Armenian languages. The server could provide a response body using HTML and English.</p>

The extension mechanisms eg. in HTML and CSS, allowed new semantics or features to be declared in the content that can be processed by conforming Web agents. Web agents get to choose whether to ignore unrecognised content or try to understand and treat unrecognised patterns as errors. When a browser encounters a syntactical error in an XHTML document, it can stop processing the document or display an error to the user, also known as draconian error-handling. An HTML document on the other hand has a more forgiving error-handling model. An unrecognised component or non well-formed structure would not prevent processing and no alert needed to be passed to the user interface. To date, HTML acts as a unifying language for human interfaces to information systems.</p>

RDF applies a particular restriction of the AAA principle in that nonsensical, inconsistent, or conflicting information can be created or inferred. It is up to processing applications to determine their confidence on the information. Hence, an important distinction: assertions made using the RDF language are claims, as opposed to facts.</p>

                      <p id='societal-circumstances'>Due to societal circumstances, eg. sponsorship and censorship by authorities, the literary underground with the help of the printing press was well underway in the 16th century.

                      <p id='print-shifting-communication'>Eisenstein postulates that the printed book played a central role in the <q>rapid dissemination of knowledge to whole new classes that created the modern new attitudes to both science and religion at the end of the fifteenth century.</q> The mere availability of prior knowledge to the public, stimulated scientific curiosity further, and eventually gave birth to the scientific revolution, p. 691. Eisenstein also contends that the communication shift in technical literature occurred even before astronomers changed their views about the structure of the universe, p. 685. Moreover, the origins of the scientific revolution was partly due to the rediscovery of classical scientific texts, and the effects of an internal strife between academic innovators and conservationists (<q>quarrels of learned men</q>), trying to control the field of knowledge outside of academia, p. 523-524, 570. Eisenstein emphasises on the <q>relevance of external social institutions to the internal, relatively autonomous, life of science</q>, p. 636, as well as the utilitarian <q>application of the mathematics to the problems of the natural world</q>, p. 683.</p>

                        <li>cooperating agents can function without going through a central agency, eg. a <q>publisher</q>.</li>
                      </ol>

                      <p>The role of the journal includes both <q>main</q> (editorial, quality control, recognition of work, marketing, and disseminating) and <q>hidden</q> (subject and community defining, and archiving) functions. The proposed <em>deconstructed journal</em> model is preferable to the <q>paper</q> influenced electronic publishing model in that both main and hidden roles can be accomplished in a distributed manner. Here, Smith emphasises allowing greater academic freedom and shifting of power and control from the monolithic third-parties to the knowledge producers, which could be realised in either an <em>institution-</em> or <em>researcher-centric</em> approach. In this process, journals with the refereeing process would link to the articles with full content hosted on the authors\u2019 Web sites. To get there, however, Smith acknowledges that for such a new paradigm to be adopted, professional and funding bodies must transition themselves to accepting the decoupling and self-controlled literature publishing model as something equivalent (in terms of academic value) to the traditional model.</p>

                      <p id='grey-literature'>After two decades, the anecdotal evidence suggests that academia acknowledges the sort of equivalence that Smith describes at varying levels. For example, while literature quality-control can be generally anywhere on the Web, on the other hand, self-published literature remains to be treated as <q>grey literature</q>, that is, any material that is outside of the traditional scholarly distribution channels, especially when it comes to academic reward systems.</p>

The article echoes earlier work in that the scholarly journals bundle multiple functions, and that this tight coupling has hindered innovation, is inefficient, and makes it difficult to improve individual functions. The article also states that the current system, ie. the bundling of the closed publishing and certification models, is unlikely to change if the communication functions are not decoupled, regardless of all the other out-of-band activities \u2013 activism or innovation \u2013 to improve the publishing models or certification mechanisms.

The authors echo many of the ideas of Smith with respect to decoupling and decentralisation, however they only go as far as describing them within the context of scholarly functions operating alongside institutional or third-party online services. While the article does not exclude the possibility of units of information being self-hosted and individually-controlled by the researchers, it is not explored further. The article concludes that the nature of the communication revolution will be through the structure and organisation of the units in the system.</p>

Third-party scholarly publishers tend to require a fixed layout with typographical guidelines for research documents, hence submissions are often required to be made as PDFs.</p>

                      <p>One of the shortcomings of the research publication system is that scientific literature in electronic formats resemble, mimic, and have similar affordances to printed papers.

The print-centric affordances lack structure that could enable better aggregation, discovery, processing, and integration \u2013 which machines excel at \u2013 and in turn help with human-led tasks.

Authors may be unable to obtain or generate a precise identifier, or lack an authoring or referencing environment which would allow them to assign identifiers appropriately.

For example, a typical journal publisher as a member of a DOI registration agency (eg. <cite><a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://www.crossref.org/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190618081912/https://www.crossref.org/' data-versiondate='2019-06-18T08:19:12Z'>CrossRef</a></cite>) submits mappings for objects of interest. Given the statement in AWWW, <q><a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#URI-persistence'>URI persistence is a matter of policy and commitment on the part of the URI owner</a></q>, DOI introduces an additional layer of social contract to govern the discovery of research artifacts. A DOI is aimed at being a persistent identifier for an object it is assigned to, and has the mechanism to refer to the URL of an object where it can be found. That is, a DOI may refer to a landing page about the actual object and not necessarily the object itself \u2013 this happens to be a common practice for literature that is not necessarily open and free. For literature that has restricted access, the resolved DOI is typically a webpage where an actor would need to go through the system\u2019s <q>paywall</q> or <q>access toll</q> in order to retrieve the content. From a machine\u2019s perspective, what the DOI identifies at the resolved location is not clear eg. company logo, tracking software, search form or the intended research object? For open literature, the resolved DOI would generally hyperlink to the actual scientific object in human-interpretable only fashion, or be part of a webpage accompanied by material unrelated to the scientific object itself, ie. information that the scientists neither assembled as part of their research nor intended for the consumer. If the actual URL of the object changes, the DOI\u2019s lookup table for the URL has to be updated. Otherwise, they'll point to dead links or unrelated information.</p>

PURL, w3id, ORCID, and DOI are PIDs. For digital objects accessible over the Internet, PIDs are intended to be used as a long-lasting reference to a unit of information, and be <em>actionable</em> in the sense that the environment can be directed to the identified source. For example, a DOI-based PID can be <samp>10.2218/ijdc.v9i1.320</samp>, and the organisation \u2013 in this case the International DOI Foundation \u2013 would be responsible to maintain an unambiguous mapping to an accessible resource. Typically once mapped, the process starts from a DOI URI <samp>https://doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v9i1.320</samp> which (currently) resolves to the location <samp>http://www.ijdc.net/article/view/9.1.331</samp> where its contents can be retrieved.

Researchers and scholars have been exchanging and collaborating on their findings and questioning, just as they were in the era of the <cite>Republic of Letters</cite>. The social dimension not only exerts a force within the research community, from the society, and eventually flowing back out to society. As the Web deeply impacts societies, in addition to using social media, researchers and academics have also been studying sociotechnical systems from their respective disciplines. We need to understand the effects of the tools we use on the ecosystem and on scientific and scholarly communication. There is a top-down social pressure for research openness and access to knowledge that is in the public interest, however, achieving it through the methods and ethics is challenging for societies. In this section, I will overview how researchers use social media, quality control and certification, and access to research knowledge in context of privilege and gatekeeping.</p>

                      <p>Contemporary social media and networking sites has been facilitating academics to exchange information. More specifically, academics use social media for a variety of reasons, to name a few: to network and collaborate; disseminate and find research results, crowd-source and crowd-fund research challenges, engage with public and foster trust on research results by providing authoritative feedback.</p>

                      <p id='online-social-media'>Online social media tools are affecting or influencing scholarly communication from a variety of fronts. For instance, with the advent of the Web and the notion academics having the right and means to exchange scholarly literature with their peers for free, there has been plethora of initiatives and developments over the course of three decades in academia, libraries, archives, as well as standards for creating, sharing and preserving (<cite><a rel='cito:citesAsDataSource' href='http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Main_Page' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190224140551/http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Main_Page' data-versiondate='2019-02-24T14:05:51Z'>Open Access Directory</a></cite>). Moreover, the call to take advantage of features offered by the new media, has opened new ways of publishing and disseminating scientific and scholarly knowledge globally, as well as institutional infrastructures being adapted to meet communication needs. For example, universities providing an online space for staff members and students to publish their profiles, as well as to share their research interests, academic output, and other educational material. Institutional repositories have been built to retain copies of scholarly work, as well as mechanisms to exchange data with other repositories.</p>

Without having any maintenance for quality, distinguishing valid, reliable, useful and ethical work from those not, would be difficult to achieve systematically. This is particularly concerning where the general public can become aware of a piece of information, yet the validity of the research findings may be inaccessible or absent, and thus have major consequences to our society and the planet \u2013 as with cases where widely agreed scientific evidence and observable effects of global climate change can be easily "questioned" by propaganda spread through mass-media by elite forces with a personal or private agenda; the amplification of the flat Earth conspiracy, and so on.</p>

                      <p id='reproducible-replicable'>Reproducible research findings refers to the notion that when the exact methods are used to replicate or repeat to reach the same findings. However, for some research, reproduction is not always possible, for example when data is sensitive, or influenced by time or space. In this case, replication can be carried out to answer the same research questions using similar or equivalent approaches. The reproduction of the original work can be either confirmatory, ie. able to reproduce, or; contradictory, unable to reproduce or inconclusive. Thus, in order to reconstruct how the data was generated and to make sense of it, data needs to be accompanied by enough detail about its provisional interpretations.</p>

                  <p>The actor and content forces are generic and internal to the scholarly market, and are considered to be indispensable in that there would not be a scientific communication market if there are no researchers and the artifacts they exchange. The accessibility and applicability forces on the other hand are external forces because they shape, give purpose to, or influence the activities and content.</p>

                  <p>The registration and archiving are objective functions in that they are external to the research process. Information exchange cannot take place if there are no usable identifiers for the units of communication or if no knowledge preservation measures are put in place. Certification and awareness are subjective communication functions \u2013 internal to the research process. Registration and awareness are different aspects of making information findable, or <em>scientific observations</em>. Certification and archiving are aspects of <em>scientific judgement</em>, ie. they act as filtering mechanisms in the information space.</p>

In order to empower scholarly communities from a systems perspective, the article posits that there should be more flexibility in what constitutes a unit of scholarly communication in order to allow registration, as well as factoring timing and the quality of what is to be registered. The article also acknowledge the presence of an additional function in the market which reflects the academic credit and policy in the current system. A derived function, <q>rewarding</q> of actors <q>for their performance in the communication system based on metrics derived from that system</q>.

In particular, the communication is becoming more <q>Web-centric</q> ie. visible, continuous, informal, instant, content-driven, and the communicated objects vary in their type, have compound composition, diverse, networked, and open.</p>

                  <p>Given that the emergence of the Web influenced the communication market by transforming it from predominantly being medium-driven into a content-driven ecosystem, as well as the research process becoming more visible on the Web (per the <q>Open Science</q> movement), the article also posit that the aforementioned indicators impact the functions in scientific communication, and in particular have a significant impact on the future of archiving. The observation is based on the archival process held on the Web; unplanned and unconstrained archiving, organically occurring, by way of Web objects being deposited across distributed and dedicated archival services. They describe the effect of Web-based archiving with respect to the four functions:</p>

                  <ul id='web-archiving-forces-functions'>
                    <li>registration: a wide variety and versions of objects that are compound, dynamic, interrelated, and interdependent are available from different Web platforms;</li>
                    <li>certification: a variety of mechanisms that are decoupled from registration;</li>
                    <li>awareness: a variety of objects being communicated in real-time and social;</li>
                    <li>archiving: <q>no constraints on the number or kinds of parties that can hold archived copies</q>, the need for <q>appropriate levels of cross-archive interoperability in order to support seamless, uniform access to archived objects</q>, that are temporally appropriate while context being preserved</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>The authors conclude that in order to address the needs of a distributed archival approach for scholarly Web objects, standards will play a central role for interoperable systems.</p>

                  <p id='rethinking-distributed-archived-scholarly-communication'>Given the dynamic nature of units of communication on the Web, vertical integration, stepping through the four functions in order (as per the traditional journal-centric ecosystem), turns out to be inadequate. Hence, an affirmation of the outlook as outlined in <cite>Rethinking Scholarly Communication</cite>, that the essential functions need to be <q cite='https://hvdsomp.info/papers/Papers/2014/iPres2014_Sompel_Treloar.pdf'>fulfilled in discreet, disaggregated, and distributed manners, and in which a variety of networked pathways interconnect the autonomous hubs that fulfill these functions</q>. The act of <q>recording</q> (or <em>registering</em> in the most general sense) a unit of communication is not a replacement for <em>archiving</em> or persistence, even if the freely available Web services are used towards this end. The authors distinguish recording and archiving in that the former is short-term, no guarantees provided, used for many read-write operations, and part of a scholarly process. Archiving serves a different function, in that it is intended for the long-term, and there is an attempt of a guarantee (or promise) and the archived artifact becomes part of the scholarly record.</p>

                  <p id='web-archivable-scholarly-communication'>The authors call for another archival paradigm that is based off the characteristics of the Web. That is, given the inherently interlinked and dynamic nature of Web objects, archived resources cannot be treated as atomic resources as they do not necessarily contain the complete content. For instance, a research document on the Web may refer to external media or interactive scripts, aggregated objects, and changing or ephemeral objects. This is in contrast to the traditional journal-centric approach to archival where all material \u2013 physical paper \u2013 can be eventually tracked to library stacks. Hence, the future of archiving needs to consider the nature of the object, including the degree to which it can be archived. The complexity and care that is required for the proper preservation of digital objects is further described in <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november05/rosenthal/11rosenthal.html' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709111136/http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november05/rosenthal/11rosenthal.html' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T11:11:36Z'>Requirements for Digital Preservation Systems</a></cite>, Rosenthal, 2005, provides a taxonomy of threat models: software, communication, network, economic, organisational, to name a few, which pose a particular risk to permanent information loss. Thus, it is important to bare these potential issues in mind when considering what scholarly units of information will contain and how they will be made available.</p>

                  <p>In recent decades there has been a global shift in communication forms used for scientific activities. This perhaps demonstrates a desire for amplification of the senses that are used to consume and create knowledge. For instance, print-centric emphasises the linearity of scientific information representation and its communication, whereas a Web-centric approach makes multimodal interactions possible within the same domain. Scientists need no longer fit their understanding of the world within the confines of static and two-dimensional descriptions of phenomena. The need to travel great distances for first-hand observations and collaboration is also reduced. With electronic media, and more specifically the Web, we have the option to also watch, listen, and participate around measured observations, instantaneously as the events occur, or after the fact around persistent and detailed logs. Just as the invention of the printing press transformed the codification and mobility of knowledge, the Web transformed and extended human and machine communication on all fronts. What will be further explored in this thesis is the extent to which our current scholarly activities make use of the inherent qualities of the Web, as well as ways to further take advantage of these qualities.</p>

While McLuhan\u2019s critique was about the effect of the print media in the electric age, it stands especially valid today in the age of interactive new media. For instance, the <em class='cool-media'>World Wide Web</em> is a <q>cool media</q> because its access, multi-linearity, and interactive possibilities offer multi-sensory states for individuals. This is in contrast to <em class='hot-media'>print</em>, considered by McLuhan to be <q>hot media</q>, demanding primarily the attention of our vision. As the printed word\u2019s requirement for the other senses is minimal, it <em>spoon-feeds</em> the content to the reader in a l-i-n-e-a-r <span class='typographic-wave'><span>f</span><span>a</span><span>s</span><span>h</span><span>i</span><span>o</span><span>n</span></span>. The literate or print culture is passive and is detached from immediate involvement because the medium has no such requirements. The cooler media on the other hand, requires a greater level of engagement from the audience at a faster rate. This increased engagement allows us to detect change and better recognise patterns, which, according to <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_grouping' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190729074952/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_grouping' data-versiondate='2019-07-29T07:49:52Z'>Gestalt laws of grouping</a></cite>, makes the whole of the information easier to follow and understand.</p>

                  <p id='what-constitutes-scholarly-contribution'>The interaction of media with our senses is an inherent property of media. The media\u2019s built-in sensory bias affects and transforms human society and psyche. Modern media, like the Web, offer extensible interactions, creative participation, and social engagement. There is a natural human desire to connect and exchange ideas, behaviour, or style with others, as well as to co-create. Given these opportunities, the fundamental question to ask here is, why should research communication be limited to, evaluated by, and rewarded on methods and practices be based on print-centric media? Scholarly communication still uses methods which date back to the invention of the <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190729074952/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press' data-versiondate='2019-07-29T07:49:52Z'>mechanical movable type printing press</a></cite> (c. 1450 CE), even in the advent of the globally accessible and interactive new media that are at our fingertips today, and at much faster turnaround times from publication to consumption than ever before. The practices correspond to publication workflows that are in place for academic communication, and have remained largely unchanged for over a century. What does it mean to have an academic achievement through a \u201cpublication\u201d? If we consider the Web as a potential supplement to or replacement for these older practices, and given that the Web can be purposed for greater possibilities than print alone, then we (members of the academic community) also need to address the question, <em>what constitutes a scholarly contribution?</em></p>

                  <p id='print-centric-hot-media'>Today, it is evident that the typical academic publishing scenario requires adherence to the <em>printability</em> aspects of the information eg. <span class='unicode-document'>page length, typographical guidelines</span>. That is, all of the encompassing data or supporting artifacts for any given research output typically must be channelled through the characteristics of print media. In practice, this leads the research community to use tools that are tailored solely for printing or viewing (on screen). This (sticking to print) leads to unnecessary information loss or arbitrary filtering of the content, which might be otherwise preserved if a different medium was used. Since print is only one possible way to represent and communicate the information, it is worthwhile to investigate and employ alternative or complimentary representations that are more appropriate given the affordances of the Web. Traditional electronic document formats, on the hot end of the media spectrum, are trying remain relevant inside a cool medium.</p>

Hence, publishers of the resources advertising an Inbox (target) are expected to be aware of using servers they trust or control for the Inbox location.</p>\n\n                      <p id='constraints'><strong>Constraints</strong>: One way to filter unwarranted notifications from being created on the server and exposed is where Inbox URLs announce their own constraints eg. <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212253/https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:53Z'>Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)</a></cite>, <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://shexspec.github.io/spec/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212253/https://shexspec.github.io/spec/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:53Z'>ShEx</a></cite>, Web Annotation Protocol, via an HTTP <code>Link</code> header or body of the resource with a <code>rel</code> value of <code>ldp:constrainedBy</code>. For example, an LDN receiver may want to allow notifications with a certain shape; a model specifying allowed and required values in a notification. This is so that senders can comply with the advertised constraint specification or the receiver may reject their notification. Rejecting notifications which do not match a specific pattern in their contents, or the <em>shape</em> of the data, is one way to filter. For example, if the Inbox owner knows that they will only ever use a consuming application which processes friend requests, they can configure their receiver to filter out anything that does not match the pattern for a friend request, helping their consumer to be more efficient. If the notification constraints are also advertised by the receiving service as structured descriptions, generation and consumption of the notifications can be further automated. Constraints are particularly useful towards providing notifications that meets a certain criteria so that it can be used effectively by consuming applications.</p>\n\n                      <p id='authenticated-inboxes'><strong>Authenticated inboxes</strong>: The requirement for reusable notifications could be seen as a potential risk for privacy. The LDN Receivers are expected to consider implementing access control on the Inbox URL as well as the individual notification URL and may restrict reading and writing to a whitelist of trusted senders. Various authentication methods which could be used alongside LDN with the idea that notifications are not necessarily public but only visible or reusable by intended parties. The receivers decide (based on their use case) which consumers (based on any criteria) can reuse. They achieve this by setting authentication and authorization settings on the notifications. As  different authentication mechanisms are appropriate for different applications, the notification protocol should ideally be usable alongside various methods such as clientside certificates, eg. WebID+TLS, token-based, eg. OAuth 2.0, or digital signatures.</p>\n\n                      <p id='personally-identifiable-information'><strong>Personally identifiable information</strong>: Notification payloads may contain any data including that which identifies the sender or the receiver. As access to the Inbox and notification data is under the control of the receiver, they ultimately determine what information may be exposed to the world. Once fetched by a third-party, any piece of information could potentially be subject to further (unauthorised) distribution and reuse. Hence, this is orthogonal to whether the notifications are ephemeral or persistent.</p>\n\n                      <p id='security-and-privacy-review'><strong>Security and Privacy Review</strong>: The LDN specification includes a <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/#security-and-privacy-review' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709211912/https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:19:12Z'>Security and Privacy Review</a></cite> covering threat models categorised as: <q cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-security-privacy-questionnaire-20151210/'>Passive Network Attackers, Active Network Attackers, Same-Origin Policy Violations, Third-Party Tracking</q> as outlined in W3C <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-security-privacy-questionnaire-20151210/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212253/https://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-security-privacy-questionnaire-20151210/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:53Z'>Self-Review Questionnaire: Security and Privacy</a></cite>.</p>\n                    "^^rdf:HTML;

As a citation results in the assigning an HTTP URI for the citing entity, it can be further semantically annotated by the actor.</p>\n\n                      <figure resource='#example-cites-as-evidence' rel='schema:hasPart' id='example-cites-as-evidence' class='listing'>\n                        <pre xml:lang='' typeof='fabio:Dataset' property='schema:description' lang='' about='#example-cites-as-evidence'><code id='citation-data-shape-must-L1'>&lt;http://example.org/article#argument&gt;</code><code id='citation-data-shape-must-L2'>  <span class='highlight-cites-as-evidence'>cito:citesAsEvidence</span> &lt;http://example.net/observation#results&gt; .</code></pre>\n\n                        <figcaption property='schema:name'>The citing entity (an argument) cites the cited entity (observation results) as source of factual evidence for statements it contains.</figcaption>\n                      </figure>\n\n                      <p id='robust-citations'><strong>Robust Citations</strong>: In order to preserve the context of the citation as well as taking content-drift and link-rot into account, first a snapshot of the cited entity\u2019s URI is created at the <cite>Internet Archive</cite>, and then both the archived URI and its datetime stamp is incorporated to the referencing hyperlink \u2013 the original citation resource.</p>\n\n                      <p id='notifying-cited-entity'><strong>Notifying Cited Entity</strong>: Once a citation is made through the dokieli user interface, dokieli proceeds to check if the cited resource advertises its own LDN inbox, and if so, sends a notification indicating the citation function.

With an ontology and a user interface appropriate for the type of content, semantic authoring can be easier than traditional composition of content and the resulting content can be of higher quality.</q> The article proposes a set of <q>quality attributes</q> \u2013 as non-functional requirements \u2013 to evaluate the performance of SCA systems: usability, customizability, generalizability, collaboration, portability, accessibility, proactivity, automation, evolvability, interoperability, and scalability. Based on the starting point of the authoring process, the authors distinguish the approaches, and generally categorised as <q>bottom-up</q> (lifting unstructured content to a semantic level) or <q>top-down</q> (semantic representations from the beginning requiring users with the knowledge of the domain), and sometimes a hybrid of the two. A survey of tools are presented (in article\u2019s Table 3) covering different types of users, expected domain knowledge, and authoring approach. The article also discusses <cite>Research and Technology Challenges</cite> and identifies a gap in addressing <q>accessibility</q>, <q>handling complexity in UIs</q>, <q>formal and systematic methods for user interface evaluation</q>, <q>heuristic evaluation</q>, <q>support of crowdsourcing</q>, UIs for ubiquitous devices.</p>\n\n                  <p>The scope of SCA is relevant because it covers some of the aspects of dokieli that can be examined.

                      <p>One of the shortcomings of the research publication system is that scientific literature in electronic formats resemble, mimic, and have similar affordances to printed papers. While the paper-centric approach has been adequate, although not necessary optimal, for human consumption and reuse, it is insufficient for machine-assisted analysis or reuse. The print-centric affordances lack structure that could enable better aggregation, discovery, processing, and integration \u2013 which machines excel at \u2013 and in turn help with human-led tasks. Representing and storing semantically structured knowledge on the Web enables automated agents to process information more intelligently.</p>

The article argues that the definition for semantic publishing should be broader in that works without a narrative are accounted for, and narrower in the sense that semantic representations should be incorporated at the time of creating and publishing entities. The <q>genuine semantic publishing</q> concept prescribes the notion of publishing 1) <em>machine interpretable</em> formal representations, 2) having <em>essential coverage</em> of the claims, 3) <em>authenticated</em> by the contributors, 4) be a <em>primary</em> component of the work, and 5) be part of <em>fine-grained</em> and <em>light-weight</em> containers.</p>

Researchers and scholars have been exchanging and collaborating on their findings and questioning, just as they were in the era of the <cite>Republic of Letters</cite>. The social dimension not only exerts a force within the research community, from the society, and eventually flowing back out to society. As the Web deeply impacts societies, in addition to using social media, researchers and academics have also been studying sociotechnical systems from their respective disciplines. We need to understand the effects of the tools we use on the ecosystem and on scientific and scholarly communication. There is a top-down social pressure for research openness and access to knowledge that is in the public interest, however, achieving it through the methods and ethics is challenging for societies. In this section, I will overview how researchers use social media, quality control and certification, and access to research knowledge in context of privilege and gatekeeping.</p>

As the medium revolutionised interactive publications, it was possible for peer review to be supplemented with online commentary as another form of quality control for scholarly literature at any state.</p>

                      <p id='function-of-peer-review'>The scientific community has been aware of the crude and fallibility of traditional peer review, for example, in cases such as, crediting bad research, good research getting dismissed for political reasons, <q>predatory publishing</q> (quality of the research content being irrelevant), or even treating commentary or opinion pieces as equivalent to scientific evaluation. <em>Nevertheless</em>, the function of peer review in the scholarly system is a form of self-regulation and certification. Without having any maintenance for quality, distinguishing valid, reliable, useful and ethical work from those not, would be difficult to achieve systematically. This is particularly concerning where the general public can become aware of a piece of information, yet the validity of the research findings may be inaccessible or absent, and thus have major consequences to our society and the planet \u2013 as with cases where widely agreed scientific evidence and observable effects of global climate change can be easily "questioned" by propaganda spread through mass-media by elite forces with a personal or private agenda; the amplification of the flat Earth conspiracy, and so on.</p>

The article examines different approaches to peer review models and systems. In context of <q>decoupled post-publication (annotation services)</q>, the article states that while there are online communities and services for open peer review, the systems are largely non-interoperable in that <q>most evaluations are difficult to discover, lost, or rarely available in an appropriate context or platform for re-use</q>.</p>

                      <p id='reproducible-replicable'>Reproducible research findings refers to the notion that when the exact methods are used to replicate or repeat to reach the same findings. However, for some research, reproduction is not always possible, for example when data is sensitive, or influenced by time or space. In this case, replication can be carried out to answer the same research questions using similar or equivalent approaches.

A typical scholarly article may include a sequence of sections, usually an abstract; introduction and background relevant to earlier work; methods used to justify experiments; research results; discussion and conclusions; and a list of references. Different forms of research eg. original, scientific, artistic, or research in the humanities, may have their own discipline-centric organisational structures for the journal article. For example, <em>Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion</em> (<abbr title='Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion'>IMRAD</abbr>) is a widely adopted standardised structure in original research articles as per survey, <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC442179/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190729124632/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC442179/' data-versiondate='2019-07-29T12:46:32Z'>The introduction, methods, results, and discussion (IMRAD) structure: a fifty-year survey</a></cite>, Sollaci, 2004. In the medical domain, <em>structured abstracts</em> are used to help with rapid comprehension by having distinct labelled sections, eg. introduction, objects, methods, results, conclusions, within the abstract of the article.</p>

                  <p>This section covers semantic structure of the narrative aspects scholarly communication. This can enhance <em>both</em> human- and machine-readability of information, in particular, representations of units irrespective of how they are produced.</p>

The imperative programming style on the other hand is about <em>how</em> the program should execute and change the program state. The declarative approach tends to be short, easy to understand, independent of implementation, less likely to contain errors as well as to easily correct, and tractable. For example, many domain-specific markup languages, such as HTML and XML-family (XSLT, SVG, MathML), and CSS are declarative. HTML simply tells the consuming agent \u2013 like a Web browser \u2013 what should appear as part of a Webpage. HTML\u2019s readability and ease of interpretation played a role in its adoption \u2013 anyone that wanted to express some information in a Webpage can "view source" to learn without any further steps.</span></p>

While this is sufficient to cover various use cases in a scholarly information space, it is limited in the sense that the granularity of machine-readable content is based on the classic hypertext model, ie. ultimately a relationship with loose semantics between documents or their parts. It is considered to be limited in terms of capturing domain-specific knowledge. This is in contrast to using RDF as the language to communicate knowledge about arbitrary things at different levels of abstraction. Atomic statements about scientific information and scholarly activities can be expressed, as well as each component of a statement being universally identifiable. The language enables the information to be serialised using different syntaxes eg. HTML+RDFa, Turtle. Perhaps most importantly, the underlying data is intended to be manipulated as a <em>graph</em> of things, where its syntactical representations remaining isomorphic across serialisations.</span></p>

Essentially, interoperable information exchange and reuse by machines is intended to work over the RDF graph that is expressed and encoded with RDFa. Here HTML merely acts as the container to encapsulate the underlying information and to offer presentations and interactions (in regardless of the RDF syntax embedded in HTML). RDFa specifies only a syntax and allows independently defined specifications (like vocabularies) to be used. RDFa defines a single, non-domain-specific syntax, used alongside a hosting language\u2019s syntax, so that fragments of information can be consistently interpretable. Existing HTTP servers can virtually serve HTML content without additional server or client-side modules or application logic.

Hovering a link with the cursor can trigger the Web browser to display the full target URL in the status bar of the application, and hence informing the user on what lies ahead before engaging further. If the user is already familiar with the link (visited earlier) or uninterested, they can skip. The interaction with the hypertext is in essence non-linear, ie. we can follow the links as far as we are able to, or interested, and then come back to where we started. Similarly, machines, like Web-crawlers are able to perform exactly the same process. Moreover, hyperlinks marked up with specific relations to their target reference can signal information that can effectively induce unique interactions. In that respect, RDFa in HTML for instance can help enrich and enable the structure for different interaction possibilities, for example though runtime JavaScript or the Web browser\u2019s built-in understanding of the underlying actions.

                      <p id='archivability-rule-of-thumb'>In the Web development community, a rule of thumb to improve archivability of Web content is to aim for general standards compliance and content accessibility. In the case of standards compliance, well-formed and valid markup ensures internal integrity of Web documents. As for better accessibility, incorporating WCAG where applicable can help user-agents, including text-only Web browsers, Web crawlers, and other agents with minimal capabilities to parse and render content. With respect to traditional Web documents, the information that is visible, observable, or human-readable from HTML is considered to set the lowest barrier to obtain content. As CSS and JavaScript are concerned with presentation and behavioural layers respectively, they play a secondary role towards archiving of "content".</p>

For example, resources referring to external scripts may load unsuccessfully given that their own independent availability. Authors refer to the notion of <q>deferred representations</q> where the final state of a resource is when all code and events have finished executing. Hence, representations rely on JavaScript to fully render do not serve well for archival crawlers that are unequipped to handle JavaScript. On the other hand, certain archival services include a feature known as <em>headless browser</em> that is capable of processing the resource similar to common GUI-based Web browsers with JavaScript enabled, and thus capturing the final state of the representation once all scripts are executed. This too however may be problematic for content that dynamically changes based on the instructions of the script. For example, a script that presents temporal content may be different at each time the archived resource is recalled.</p>

                  <p>In this section I examine some of the existing Web standards and practices for the structure and semantics of scholarly information with focus on narrative documents and observational data. Scholarly documents with the characteristics of a continuous prose, such as those of research articles typically includes factual information about an investigation with supporting provenance-level information and references to underlying data. Annotations in the general sense can be similar to articles, however they are generally intended to encapsulate an indirection where target resources are associated with annotation activities with motivations, eg. commenting, bookmarking, or classifying. Notifications for scholarly activities serve as a way to inform a target of interest about events in general.

                  <p>The structure of a scholarly journal article has been mostly conserved during the evolution of scientific communication. A typical scholarly article may include a sequence of sections, usually an abstract; introduction and background relevant to earlier work; methods used to justify experiments; research results; discussion and conclusions; and a list of references. Different forms of research eg. original, scientific, artistic, or research in the humanities, may have their own discipline-centric organisational structures for the journal article.

The imperative programming style on the other hand is about <em>how</em> the program should execute and change the program state. The declarative approach tends to be short, easy to understand, independent of implementation, less likely to contain errors as well as to easily correct, and tractable. For example, many domain-specific markup languages, such as HTML and XML-family (XSLT, SVG, MathML), and CSS are declarative. HTML simply tells the consuming agent \u2013 like a Web browser \u2013 what should appear as part of a Webpage. HTML\u2019s readability and ease of interpretation played a role in its adoption \u2013 anyone that wanted to express some information in a Webpage can "view source" to learn without any further steps.</span></p>

While this is sufficient to cover various use cases in a scholarly information space, it is limited in the sense that the granularity of machine-readable content is based on the classic hypertext model, ie. ultimately a relationship with loose semantics between documents or their parts. It is considered to be limited in terms of capturing domain-specific knowledge. This is in contrast to using RDF as the language to communicate knowledge about arbitrary things at different levels of abstraction. Atomic statements about scientific information and scholarly activities can be expressed, as well as each component of a statement being universally identifiable. The language enables the information to be serialised using different syntaxes eg. HTML+RDFa, Turtle. Perhaps most importantly, the underlying data is intended to be manipulated as a <em>graph</em> of things, where its syntactical representations remaining isomorphic across serialisations.</span></p>

Essentially, interoperable information exchange and reuse by machines is intended to work over the RDF graph that is expressed and encoded with RDFa. Here HTML merely acts as the container to encapsulate the underlying information and to offer presentations and interactions (in regardless of the RDF syntax embedded in HTML). RDFa specifies only a syntax and allows independently defined specifications (like vocabularies) to be used. RDFa defines a single, non-domain-specific syntax, used alongside a hosting language\u2019s syntax, so that fragments of information can be consistently interpretable.

Hovering a link with the cursor can trigger the Web browser to display the full target URL in the status bar of the application, and hence informing the user on what lies ahead before engaging further. If the user is already familiar with the link (visited earlier) or uninterested, they can skip. The interaction with the hypertext is in essence non-linear, ie. we can follow the links as far as we are able to, or interested, and then come back to where we started. Similarly, machines, like Web-crawlers are able to perform exactly the same process. Moreover, hyperlinks marked up with specific relations to their target reference can signal information that can effectively induce unique interactions. In that respect, RDFa in HTML for instance can help enrich and enable the structure for different interaction possibilities, for example though runtime JavaScript or the Web browser\u2019s built-in understanding of the underlying actions.

That is, if an application is designed to <em>only</em> work with a particular flavour or subset of HTML, then it would not be able to work with arbitrary HTML documents on the Web. Hence, having profiles or grammars in and itself not an issue, however its <em>effects</em> are likely to be that they are less interoperable than they can be. This is in contrast to applications safely ignoring information patterns they do not understand or interested in using, even if they have their preferred internal grammars or HTML templates. From the consuming side, if the application\u2019s information <em>reuse</em> is dependent on HTML a specific schema or tree structure, effectively locks the application into coping with those patterns, and ultimately less flexible about handling expressions that the application is unfamiliar with.

With respect to traditional Web documents, the information that is visible, observable, or human-readable from HTML is considered to set the lowest barrier to obtain content.

For example, resources referring to external scripts may load unsuccessfully given that their own independent availability. Authors refer to the notion of <q>deferred representations</q> where the final state of a resource is when all code and events have finished executing. Hence, representations rely on JavaScript to fully render do not serve well for archival crawlers that are unequipped to handle JavaScript. On the other hand, certain archival services include a feature known as <em>headless browser</em> that is capable of processing the resource similar to common GUI-based Web browsers with JavaScript enabled, and thus capturing the final state of the representation once all scripts are executed. This too however may be problematic for content that dynamically changes based on the instructions of the script.

RASH aims at sharing scholarly documents through the Web while working within the existing publishing workflow, and is expected to be produced from MS Word, ODT and LaTeX sources. RASH has been developed as a formal grammar using RelaxNG which includes a subset of elements \u2013 32 \u2013 from HTML5. With the exception of the <code>script</code> element, it is compiled of printable elements. Its grammar facilitates RASH documents to run against a markup validator, to convert between sources, rendering for Web and print media, and to extract additional semantics. Its rationale for representing human-visible and machine-readable information in HTML varies eg. title, authors, keywords of an article are used as hidden metadata, and require additional processing to make it human-visible in the Web browser, as such a dependency on JavaScript support and being enabled. The resulting grammar favours simplicity towards authoring over expressing accurate or appropriate semantics eg. <code>h1</code> for all heading levels is used, as opposed to HTML5\u2019s required heaving levels (<samp>hX</samp>). The format allows DPUB-ARIA and RDFa annotations, as well as embedding JSON-LD, Turtle, and RDF/XML data islands with the <code>script</code> element.</p>

One of its high-level goals is to enable structured metadata as well as semantic enrichments, accessibility, internationalisation. It applies the notion of <q>semantic overlays</q> for its markup patterns with focus on role-based semantics as defined in WAI-ARIA, DPUB-ARIA, and semantic representations using RDFa. The \u2013 work-in-progress \u2013 specification explains how concepts for people and organisation, article semantics, schema roles, actions, citations, document rights, and so forth can be marked using appropriate vocabularies, using the schema.org vocabulary as base. In order to simplify authoring, where applicable, it is encouraged to use RDFa markup patterns where the depth (level of nesting in the DOM tree) for the RDF statements would be relatively flat. One consequences of this rule of thumb may be that there can be duplicate information or parts of the information being human-visible whereas some others would be intended only for machine use.</p>

                    <li>The generation or use of markup is dependent on specific environments for use or interchange, media or devices.</li>
                    <li>The structure of the information is scoped to general-purpose scholarly documents, as opposed to for example encapsulating social (scholarly) Web activities.</li>
                    <li>The structure and semantics of information is fundamentally based on HTML or XML (as opposed to the RDF language).</li>
                    <li>In some cases, there is information duplicity as human and machine consumers are served with different data.</li>

It has a highly structured mechanism to represent statistical observations, classifications, and data structures. Given that SDMX is arguably the most widely used standard for statistical data exchange (among statistical agencies and others), a great amount of statistical data about our societies is yet to be discoverable and identifiable through the Open Web Platform.

                      <p>In <cite><a rel='cito:usesConclusionsFrom' href='https://csarven.ca/linked-statistical-data-analysis' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212225/https://csarven.ca/linked-statistical-data-analysis' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:25Z'>Linked Statistical Data Analysis</a></cite>, Capadisli, 2013, puts forward an approach based on decentralised (and federated) structured queries to retrieve statistical data from various SPARQL endpoints, conducting various data analyses (eg. regression analysis), and providing the results of the analysis as Linked Data back to the user. The system demonstrating the mechanism stores the analysis in RDF to enable future discovery and reuse eg. researchers looking up statistically significant results based on a set of indicators for a specific reference area. As a result, distributed linked statistics with accompanying provenance data can be more easily explored and analysed by interested parties.</p>

                      <p>The approach expects that the data is modelled using the RDF Data Cube vocabulary and has <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/#wf' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212226/http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:26Z'>Well-formed cubes</a></cite>. Essential checks for integrity constraints include: 1) a unique data structure definition (DSD) is used for a dataset, 2) the DSD includes a measure (value of each observation), 3) concept dimensions have code lists, and 4) codes are from the code lists.</p>

                      <p>In order to compare variables in observations across statistical datasets, there needs to be an agreement on the concepts that are being matched for in respective observations. In the case of regression analysis, the primary concern is about reference areas (ie. locations), and making sure that the comparison made for the observations from dataset<sub>x</sub> (independent variable) and dataset<sub>y</sub> (dependent variable) are using concepts that are interlinked (using the property <code>skos:exactMatch</code>). Practically, a concept eg. Switzerland, from at least one of the dataset\u2019s code lists should have a relation to the other dataset\u2019s concept. It ensures that there is a reliable degree of confidence that the particular concept is interchangeable or the degree in which the concepts being comparable. Hence, the measure corresponding to the phenomenon being observed, is about the same location in both datasets. To this end, concepts in the datasets were interlinked.</p>

                      <p>In order to foster trust and confidence for data consumers (human and machine), the analysis is accompanied with provenance data. The analysis includes a <cite><a rel='cito:usesConclusionsFrom' href='https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/UI#OhYeah' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212226/https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/UI' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:26Z'>Oh yeah?</a></cite> reference (in HTML as well as in RDF serializations) intended to guide the data consumer to a resource about the provenance activity \u2013 using the PROV-O vocabulary \u2013 about the performed analysis. These previously generated provenance activities provide links to all data sources which were used for the analysis, query construct for data aggregation, as well as metadata about the used tools, assigned license, production timestamps, and responsible agents for the generated analysis. Thus, in addition to analysis metadata, the user is able to track the data all the way back to its origins (at the statistical agencies), and reproduce or compare their results.</p>

                      <p>The proposed approach focuses on the scalability of the system with minimal human intervention. That is, new statistical dataset can be independently published while being expressed with relevant statistical vocabularies, and sufficient interlinks between concepts, then applications can discover them and perform queries in a uniform way. Hence, applications <em>only</em> need to be made aware of the location of new datasets.</p>

        """
                  <p>The W3C <q>Technical Reports</q> are intended to help different (current or future) implementations to have common core functionality and quality, comply with accessibility and internationalisation guidelines, and take security and privacy considerations into account. When an application, for instance, implements a specification, it can be checked against that specification\u2019s conformance criteria for normative requirements. Specifications are typically accompanied with test suites to assist implementations to identify their conformance level as well as areas for improvement. Similarly, reports and feedback help specifications to improve and advance towards publication. So, specifications and conforming implementations are integral to ensuring interoperable applications.</p>

                  <p>As a concrete example of the benefits of resource-centric notifications, I took the liberty to both use the W3C process of creating a test suite for LDN, and the submission of reports about implementations to exemplify the LDN protocol itself, as well as to generate discoverable Linked Data about the specification and its implementations. The LDN <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212253/https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:53Z'>test suite</a></cite> is itself an LDN implementation for the purpose of automating the collection and aggregation of implementation reports which were used directly towards the formal standardisation process.</p>

                  <p>The LDN test suite covers each requirement of the specification with individual tests, and the test suite documentation is semantically linked with the specification itself accordingly. Once the tests have been run, the test suite generates a similarly linked implementation report. This report is submitted using LDN itself as the notification mechanism. The listing of implementation reports (software conforming to the specification) is automatically updated and are accessible as their own registered units of information.</p>


                  <p id='ldn-test-suites'>The LDN test suite puts the LDN protocol into practice by acting as an LDN receiver implementation (based on <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://github.com/csarven/mayktso' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212253/https://github.com/csarven/mayktso' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:53Z'>mayktso</a></cite>). It also acts as a sender and consumer LDN implementation. Each part of the test suite (for <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/sender'>Senders</a>, <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/receiver'>Receivers</a>, and <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/consumer'>Consumers</a>) advertise an <code>ldp:inbox</code>. Upon completion of a run of the tests, the system generates the report data and sends an LDN notification to the Inbox. The payload of the notification is the full report as RDF.</p>

                  <p id='ldn-consumers'>As an LDN Consumer, the test suite generates the <a href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/summary'>summary</a> of the reports by fetching and processing Inbox contents. The notifications are aggregated automatically, and the semantics of the submitted reports are retained.</p>

                  <p>The services are decoupled; that is, an implementer may generate their report independently of the test suite, and submit it via the standard LDN protocol. Furthermore, projects can implement their own consumers and reuse the report data generated by the test suite directly, for example to demonstrate to potential users their conformance to the LDN specification.</p>

                  <p>All reports have their own URLs, and a human-readable representation in HTML+RDFa, in addition to JSON-LD or other RDF syntax per <code>HTTP OPTIONS</code> and <code>Accept-Post</code> negotiation at this particular test server. See for example <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://dokie.li/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212253/https://dokie.li/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:53Z'>dokieli</a></cite>\u2019s <a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/reports/2c5af2f0-f832-11e6-a642-0dd857219753'>implementation report and test results</a> as a sender. This provides the human-visible information, eg. what was tested and the results also in machine-readable form. The report can be seen as a dataset composed of observations based on the structure that was specified in the specification. Hence, each test report is a <code>qb:DataSet</code> (and generally equivalent in <code>as:Object</code>) where its <code>qb:structure</code> refers to <code>https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/#data-structure-definition</code>. The dataset has <code>as:published</code> and <code>as:actor</code> for the agent that initiated the test and generated the report. The report may be accompanied with an additional <code>as:summary</code>. An example report at <a href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/reports/2c5af2f0-f832-11e6-a642-0dd857219753' class='highlight-observation-url'>https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/reports/2c5af2f0-f832-11e6-a642-0dd857219753</a> has the following core information:</p>

                  <p>All of the sender, receiver, and consumer reports are available in separate aggregate tables in <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsEvidence' href='https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/summary' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212254/https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/summary' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:22:54Z'>LDN Tests Summary</a></cite>. The summary is a <code>void:Dataset</code> where each report is linked as a <code>void:subset</code>. This makes individual reports alternatively findable if the exploration starts from the summary of all test results.</p>

                  <p>The test suite software fulfills the base required functionality of the LDN protocol.

        "\n                  <p>The Web\u2019s design stands out because of its absence of centralised control, both for technical reasons of scalability and resilience as well as a societal need to exercise creative and effective communication. A challenge in such large-scale decentralised networks is how related publications can be semantically interlinked, even if they are authored and published by different parties. Centralising their publications is practiced by the majority of authoring networks today, demanding authors to give up some or all of their control in exchange for technical simplicity.</p>\n\n                  <p>We can approach an alternative to this centralisation by adopting Web-centric workflows that are inherently interoperable by design, but most importantly by enabling the creators and the users of data and applications to be autonomous entities, working towards the democratisation of scholarly knowledge for humans and machines. One way to achieve this is by decentralisation and decoupling of data and applications. By <dfn typeof='skos:Concept' resource='#concept-scheme' rel='skos:topConceptOf' property='skos:prefLabel' id='concept-decentralisation' about='#concept-decentralisation'>decentralisation</dfn>, I mean <span property='skos:definition' about='#concept-decentralisation'>data and applications are loosely coupled, and users can choose where their data is stored. I focus on Web-based decentralisation, where content is transported over HTTP, and resources are identified with URIs.</span></p>\n\n                  <p>The future of self-registration of scholarly units depends in large part on how well its practitioners, advocates, educators alike, are able to reconcile the ideals that the medium offers with the realities of the commercial third-party systems within which scholarly communication operates and the homogenizing influences of scholarly socialisation.</p>\n\n                  <p>While these challenges are technically surmountable, they need to be taken seriously if, the extreme case where <em>anyone can say anything about anything</em> is subject to be treated on equal grounds as a piece of information that is well certified. One contemporary and popular example of this scenario is where nearly all scientists being in agreement on the presence of global warming, climate change, and its consequences. In order to honour a commitment to public service, scientific communication \u2013 independent to self-registration \u2013 must remain grounded on reproducible and replicable facts and explanations, as well as pertain attributable and accountable participants. The output affects society, from journalism, advancement of scientific knowledge, policy making, as well public opinion and perception.</p>\n\n                  <p>Decentralised authoring, publication, and annotation furthermore have the potential to impact areas in which centralised services currently determine the pace of evolution. Scientific publishing, for instance, is often bound to centralised review and dissemination processes. Instead, rigorous scientific discourse can still be realised with an open, decentralised environment for the annotation of manuscripts, which can potentially reach interested parties in a timely manner. Trust then no longer stems from a finite process with limited transparency, but is rather continuously assessed by repeated independent validation. Publication thereby becomes the starting point rather than the end point of the scholarly communication process.

I derive non-functional requirements for systems to aim at addressing the forces and functions in scientific communication through the following:</p>\n\n                  <ul>\n                    <li><em>Interoperability</em> to improve discovery, accessibility, integrability, and reusability.</li>\n                    <li><em>Security and privacy</em> to honour desire to remain safe and information not to be shared without consent.</li>\n                    <li><em>Modularity and extensibility</em> to enable evolvable and reconfigurable systems.</li>\n                    <li><em>Data integrity, transparency, and reliability</em> towards building trust.</li>\n                    <li><em>Persistence and preservation</em> to ensure that units of scholarly information preserves into the future.</li>\n                  </ul>\n\n                  <p>In order to support publishers and consumers (in the most general sense of <em>actor</em> roles), it is important to seek system designs that give control to its users at various fronts.

While Eisenstein\u2019s account of the history is not regarded as doctrine, the work demonstrates that the printing press, as a technological innovation, was a potent force in the evolution of social systems, as well as a communication technology which intensified the evolutionary process in the storage and dissemination of information and data. Perhaps more generally, Eisenstein explains how <q>printing altered <em>written communications within the Commonwealth of Learning</em></q>, p. xiv.</p>\n\n                      <p id='republic-of-letters'><strong>Republic of Letters</strong>: With the growing power of the printing press since the 15th century, and sufficiently large international readers across Europe, the mass production and distribution of printed material gave rise to the formation of intellectuals as a distinct and independent social class.

By 1640 <q>science had risen</q> mostly in the underground, and pre-dated the discovery and improvement of the telescope p. 685; the RoL; and the establishment of the RS. With the help of the RS later on, new discoveries and theories were disseminated abroad, p. 664.</p>\n\n                      <p id='print-shifting-communication'>Eisenstein postulates that the printed book played a central role in the <q>rapid dissemination of knowledge to whole new classes that created the modern new attitudes to both science and religion at the end of the fifteenth century.</q> The mere availability of prior knowledge to the public, stimulated scientific curiosity further, and eventually gave birth to the scientific revolution, p. 691. Eisenstein also contends that the communication shift in technical literature occurred even before astronomers changed their views about the structure of the universe, p. 685. Moreover, the origins of the scientific revolution was partly due to the rediscovery of classical scientific texts, and the effects of an internal strife between academic innovators and conservationists (<q>quarrels of learned men</q>), trying to control the field of knowledge outside of academia, p. 523-524, 570. Eisenstein emphasises on the <q>relevance of external social institutions to the internal, relatively autonomous, life of science</q>, p. 636, as well as the utilitarian <q>application of the mathematics to the problems of the natural world</q>, p. 683.</p>\n                   "^^rdf:HTML.

While McLuhan\u2019s critique was about the effect of the print media in the electric age, it stands especially valid today in the age of interactive new media. For instance, the <em class='cool-media'>World Wide Web</em> is a <q>cool media</q> because its access, multi-linearity, and interactive possibilities offer multi-sensory states for individuals. This is in contrast to <em class='hot-media'>print</em>, considered by McLuhan to be <q>hot media</q>, demanding primarily the attention of our vision.

The literate or print culture is passive and is detached from immediate involvement because the medium has no such requirements. The cooler media on the other hand, requires a greater level of engagement from the audience at a faster rate. This increased engagement allows us to detect change and better recognise patterns, which, according to <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_grouping' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190729074952/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_grouping' data-versiondate='2019-07-29T07:49:52Z'>Gestalt laws of grouping</a></cite>, makes the whole of the information easier to follow and understand.</p>\n\n                  <p id='what-constitutes-scholarly-contribution'>The interaction of media with our senses is an inherent property of media. The media\u2019s built-in sensory bias affects and transforms human society and psyche. Modern media, like the Web, offer extensible interactions, creative participation, and social engagement. There is a natural human desire to connect and exchange ideas, behaviour, or style with others, as well as to co-create. Given these opportunities, the fundamental question to ask here is, why should research communication be limited to, evaluated by, and rewarded on methods and practices be based on print-centric media? Scholarly communication still uses methods which date back to the invention of the <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190729074952/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press' data-versiondate='2019-07-29T07:49:52Z'>mechanical movable type printing press</a></cite> (c. 1450 CE), even in the advent of the globally accessible and interactive new media that are at our fingertips today, and at much faster turnaround times from publication to consumption than ever before. The practices correspond to publication workflows that are in place for academic communication, and have remained largely unchanged for over a century. What does it mean to have an academic achievement through a \u201cpublication\u201d? If we consider the Web as a potential supplement to or replacement for these older practices, and given that the Web can be purposed for greater possibilities than print alone, then we (members of the academic community) also need to address the question, <em>what constitutes a scholarly contribution?</em></p>\n\n                  <p id='print-centric-hot-media'>Today, it is evident that the typical academic publishing scenario requires adherence to the <em>printability</em> aspects of the information eg. <span class='unicode-document'>page length, typographical guidelines</span>. That is, all of the encompassing data or supporting artifacts for any given research output typically must be channelled through the characteristics of print media. In practice, this leads the research community to use tools that are tailored solely for printing or viewing (on screen). This (sticking to print) leads to unnecessary information loss or arbitrary filtering of the content, which might be otherwise preserved if a different medium was used. Since print is only one possible way to represent and communicate the information, it is worthwhile to investigate and employ alternative or complimentary representations that are more appropriate given the affordances of the Web. Traditional electronic document formats, on the hot end of the media spectrum, are trying remain relevant inside a cool medium.</p>\n\n                  <p>This section served to acknowledge initiatives and developments that went into scholarly communication in the age of information and Web, against their historical backdrop. It also introduces some frameworks for description and analysis of technologies and processes particular to scholarly communication, and communication mediums in general, which I will continue to refer to through the rest of this thesis. Subsequent sections are dedicated to devising a scholarly space that is more fitting to the medium of the Web.</p>\n                "^^rdf:HTML;

An interpretation entails that a given content can be identified or discovered; comprehended in context of where and how it is used; as well being to put it to further use. Scientific and scholarly knowledge representations using information models that are based on Web standards brought through open consensus benefit from wide reuse.</p>

                      <p id='interoperability'><strong>Interoperability</strong>: In order to achieve cooperative systems, interoperable mechanisms are essential. One widely successful approach to have interoperable systems is through the adoption of open standards for protocols and languages that are arrived through open consensus. As per Linked Data design principles, this is accomplished with HTTP for communication, URI for identification, and RDF as language. While a decentralised system can enable each entity to be autonomous, some level of agreement is needed on the network for communication to take place. Systems that are interoperable by design have the benefit of interacting with other systems without having prior or out-of-band knowledge about them. This kind of interoperability can be contrasted with <em>post-facto</em> interoperability that is typically due to propriety designs at the discretion of each party, and then bridging the systems with application adapters and semantic mappings. In such cases, given two systems, one system adopts the others\u2019 protocol, API, or format, or they build specialised mechanisms in order to communicate. Systems that do not use open standards or have specialised technological extensions that are only useful within their own environment are generally considered to be vendor lock-in solutions. Here we seek agreements on Web standards established through open consensus, as opposed to independent and individual design choices made in application implementations.</p>

                      <p>Systems vary on their level of interoperability. For instance, a service may require their own user account or authentication mechanism to be used when interacting with data on the Web; users may have to use a particular application to access, create, share or reuse information; applications may need to be reconfigured to reuse the information that is created elsewhere. In the <cite><a href='#acid-test'>Acid Test</a></cite> section I propose criteria to self-assess accessibility and interoperability of artifacts in scholarly communication.</p>

                      <p>There is a balance between free expression of structure and semantics (through autonomy) and the degree of a communication (interoperability) that different parties can achieve. At the same time, as concentration or centralisation of ideas is ultimately inescapable, interoperability influences or limits the choices a system can take. Hence, we embrace the notion of interoperability as a trade-off, ie. it is better to seek and adapt design patterns that are expected or intended to be useful for the ecosystem. Hence, interoperability is a social construct with the intention of balancing autonomy and cooperative systems.</p>

                      <p>In order to have optimal means of discovery, exchanging, and reusing information, systems and data should opt for open standards and widely acknowledged best practices wherever possible. Linked Data technologies include some of the essentials to achieve this, and are well-suited to fulfill the four functions of scholarly communication on the Web.</p>

                      <p>Thus we refer to <q>universal access</q> in the widest sense that any agent; human, machine, or other can effectively access information and participate in interacting with different systems.</p>

                  <p>One of the functions of an online identity is to a identify a persisting entity at a particular time and context. The construction of an online identity of an entity eg. individual, organisation, community, state, can be complex in that it is interconnected with social and technical systems, and it can be issued \u2013 declared to exist, named, or be referenceable \u2013 in different ways. Entities being universally and uniquely identifiable on or off the Web entails that they can be attributed for their contributions, develop their reputations, be accountable for their actions and research output, as well as play an integral role towards building trust. An actor is an indispensable force in research communication, and enabling identity agency is both relevant and foundational.</p>

                  <p id='third-party-controlled-identity'><strong>Third-party controlled identity</strong>: Community or state controlled identifiers for identities are a class of identifiers that are ultimately third-party controlled in that their ownership, governance, description is beyond an individual\u2019s jurisdiction. The creation and control of identifiers by a group has the quality of long-term promise for persistence. Typically there are policies in place which promise their longevity, and procedures in the event that the group ceases to manage the identifiers. For example, ORCID URIs are intended to be part of the scholarly commons where they managed by the <cite><a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://orcid.org/about/community' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190729124641/https://orcid.org/about/community' data-versiondate='2019-07-29T12:46:41Z'>ORCID community</a></cite>. The ORCID URI and profile description is useful to researchers, organisations, as well as to interlink researcher objects, however it is ultimately intended to serve the research community, and the systems that use it. One unintended consequence of this kind of centralisation in scholarly communication is that a growing number of institutions and publishers require researchers to participate with their ORCID identifiers, as opposed to any URI of a researcher. The resulting effects of <cite><a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://orcid.org/content/requiring-orcid-publication-workflows-open-letter' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190729124642/https://orcid.org/content/requiring-orcid-publication-workflows-open-letter' data-versiondate='2019-07-29T12:46:42Z'>such initiatives</a></cite> are counter to autonomous participation in that a researcher has to conform to the terms and policies of multiple third-parties. On the other hand, the administration of the URI by the ORCID organisation removes the burden of maintaining the URI as well as the profile URL. In this case, a "trusted" third-party takes care of the identifier, whereas researchers are responsible of updating the content.</p>

                  <p id='researcher-identifier-academic-freedom'>While some scholarly societies adopt identifiers like ORCID given their agreed potential benefits, it can also be harmful in the case of tracking researchers; where they work, who they work for or collaborate with, what they work on.

The collected user data is shared with ad networks and data brokers. Unauthorised third-party tracking of users online activities is particularly concerning even in the case of <em>public sector</em> websites, which are expected to be more privacy respecting than "ordinary" websites (as per <abbr title='General Data Protection Regulation'>GDPR</abbr> in the EU).

                  <p id='multiple-identities'><strong>Multiple identities</strong>: Individuals may want to be associated with multiple identities to fulfill diverse needs and social expectations. For instance, academics, politicians, employees, and artists, to name a few, may want to perform their online activities using public identifiers, so that they can be discovered, attributed, rewarded, trusted etc. There can also be quasi-public identities issued by a government or a bank to connect individuals to the physical world. Furthermore, individuals may wish to have several personal \u2013 public or private \u2013 identities and self representations, eg. on social networks, to address different needs. At any event, identities and corresponding identifiers can be registered and managed by different entities, and may be interlinked.</p>

                  <p id='orcid-sameas-webid'>For instance, while ORCID profile description has constraints, it allows extensibility in the form of asserting a "same as" relation through its UI, so that the ORCID URI can be linked to other WebIDs.

My personal WebID which is under my control is <a href='https://csarven.ca/#i'>https://csarven.ca/#i</a>.

                  <p id='linking-identities'>The <code class='highlight-predicate-sameas'>owl:sameAs</code> and <code>contact:preferredURI</code> information provides an opportunity for applications consuming the ORCID WebID to potentially discover more information about other entities. This is particularly useful as the ORCID WebID Profile is not completely open to add arbitrary information. For example, specifying a person\u2019s picture or their contacts is not currently possible with ORCID, however, if the alternative profiles (https://csarven.ca/#i) contain such information, they can be purposed to know more about the entity.</p>

                  <p id='social-graph'><strong>Social Graph</strong>: Identity profiles can further describe their relationships to other identities and hence form a network of self-described profiles. This is useful in that relationships between profiles of people, groups, organisations, and even software agents can manifest an information space that at its core has social affordances. That is, different kinds of relationships between entities can be expressed for different use cases, where each identity is independently controlled by its owners. For example:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>identifying a layer of trusted (or acknowledged) network of people</li>

The WWW project merges the techniques of information retrieval and hypertext to
make an easy but powerful global information system.

The project started with the philosophy that much academic information should
be freely available to anyone. It aims to allow information sharing within
internationally dispersed teams, and the dissemination of information by
support groups.</pre>

                          <p>The Web architecture permits agents to communicate through different protocols eg. HTTP, FTP, SMTP are application layer protocols in the <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105642/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:42Z'>Internet Protocol Suite</a></cite> (<abbr title='Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Application and Support'>RFC 1123</abbr>). In this thesis, the focus is on HTTP for data communication, ie. the structured requests and responses exchanged by Web agents. For example, when a <em>user-agent</em> (like a Web browser) initiates a request to access the contents of a resource identified by an HTTP URI (<em>dereferencing</em>), a server responds with a message body including a representation of the resource state, and data about the response. The content of the response URL (HTTP URI) is a particular state in that it has a presentation and controls (affordances) that can be further engaged with, eg. hyperlinks to follow; data forms that can be submitted; location of alternate representations. One particular description of this interaction is given in 2000 by Fielding, in <cite><a rel='cito:obtainsBackgroundFrom' href='http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105643/https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:43Z'>Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a></cite>, commonly referred to as <cite>Representational State Transfer</cite> (<abbr title='Representational State Transfer'>REST</abbr>): a set of architectural constraints for distributed hypermedia systems.

                          <p id='safe-interactions'>There are two categories of interactions: safe and unsafe. A <dfn>safe interaction</dfn> is one where the requested resource\u2019s state does not change. When an agent makes a retrieval request (<code>HTTP GET</code>), it has no obligation beyond dereferencing the URL. An <dfn>unsafe interaction</dfn> on the other hand may cause a resource to change its state, and that the user may be held accountable, depending on the semantics of the interaction. For example, an agent sending an <code>HTTP POST</code> request with a payload can get a response indicating that a new resource was created, that the resource represented by the URI was deleted by an <code>HTTP DELETE</code> request, or that the agent is unauthorised to either create or delete the resource.</p>

                          <p id='representations'>When a client requests a resource, the server may return a <em>particular</em> representation of a resource that is the result of a "negotiation" between them. For example, a client may indicate that it would accept the resource in HTML, Turtle, and JSON-LD data formats, and in English and Armenian languages. The server could provide a response body using HTML and English.</p>

The extension mechanisms eg. in HTML and CSS, allowed new semantics or features to be declared in the content that can be processed by conforming Web agents. Web agents get to choose whether to ignore unrecognised content or try to understand and treat unrecognised patterns as errors. When a browser encounters a syntactical error in an XHTML document, it can stop processing the document or display an error to the user, also known as draconian error-handling. An HTML document on the other hand has a more forgiving error-handling model. An unrecognised component or non well-formed structure would not prevent processing and no alert needed to be passed to the user interface. To date, HTML acts as a unifying language for human interfaces to information systems.</p>

                      <p id='rdf-unifying-language'>Conceptually, RDF was in the fabric of the Web from the start. By <em>naming</em> things with URIs, we can construct structured sentences with RDF. By comparison, HTML at its core is a terse approach to representing and linking knowledge. RDF on the other hand is intended to be a unifying language for machine interfaces to data systems. I will further discuss language mixing with RDF in HTML and XML-family languages via <cite><a href='#rdfa'>RDFa</a></cite>.</p>

                      <p id='aaa'>One conceptual view of the Web is that <q cite='https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/RDFnot#ER'>anyone being (technically) allowed to say anything about anything</q> (<abbr title='Anyone can say Anything about Anything'>AAA</abbr>). One consequence of AAA is that while systems (and reasoners within) can operate under both the <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world_assumption' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105644/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world_assumption' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:44Z'>open-world assumption</a></cite> (<abbr title='Open-world Assumption'>OWA</abbr>) or the <cite><a rel='cito:citesForInformation' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-world_assumption' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709105644/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-world_assumption' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T10:56:44Z'>closed-world assumption</a></cite> (<abbr title='Closed-world Assumption'>CWA</abbr>), the Web ultimately uses the OWA framework because new knowledge can always make its way into the system, and lack of knowledge does not imply falsity. RDF applies a particular restriction of the AAA principle in that nonsensical, inconsistent, or conflicting information can be created or inferred. It is up to processing applications to determine their confidence on the information. Hence, an important distinction: assertions made using the RDF language are claims, as opposed to facts.</p>

Each service generally has a custom API and vocabulary that a trusted client application (normally hosted on the same server) uses to interact with the server in order to perform <abbr title='Create, Read, Update, and Delete'>CRUD</abbr> operations through the user interface.

Annotations may be private, public, or for a group, and can be threaded to form conversations around a piece of content. Each instance of a client application is preconfigured to use its own API endpoint against a particular server to perform CRUD operations, such as creating and finding annotations and related data. Actors use the client application to control the user accounts at a server or preconfigured identity providers eg. hypothes.is, orcid.org, acknowledged by a server. Annotations can be self-hosted, however different servers do not federate. The HTML representations of annotations requires JavaScript to be available and enabled on the user-agent in order to look up and fetch the annotation\u2019s contents in JSON from its API and update the <abbr title='Document Object Model'>DOM</abbr>. The annotation URLs, proxy, and the browser extension uses the <cite>Google Analytics</cite> tracking service per active URL. On active URLs, the client application by default makes API calls to the Hypothes.is server to check for annotations. On-demand archiving services like the Internet Archive are currently unable to properly archive an annotation\u2019s contents. It is possible to fetch an annotation that is represented with the WA Data Model from a server, however the annotation is not machine-discoverable ie. other applications will need to be uniquely configured with Hypothes.is\u2019s annotation URL template in order to acquire a JSON-LD representation - which is semantically a subset of the information provided in the HTML and JSON representations.</p>

                      <p>One common architectural aspect to these systems is that while they have some characteristics of a loosely coupled system, the server is expected to work with a designated client application. For instance, they require account creation and data storage with respect to an appointed centralised service. In essence, the user interface is restricted to communicate with a particular service endpoint, as well as an authority that governs all actor identities and the data they have produced. They allow multiple participants to annotate and hold discussions around the primary content; users must access their accounts to be notified of updates to conversations, and data from both the main content and related discussion is confined to the service which was used to create it. The data formats and schemas are consistent across storage instances in that it is possible to migrate data from one location to another using the same server application, storage mechanism and data schema. Archivability of Web resources varies and their access being at the discretion of server owners.</p>

The client application was integrated into Amaya where it was able to store and recall annotations locally or from a remote annotation server, with the expectation of an access controlled server using the standard HTTP authentication mechanisms.

Annotea has a <cite><a rel='cito:discusses' href='https://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/User/Protocol.html' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212307/https://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/User/Protocol.html' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:07Z'>protocol</a></cite> that specifies the CRUD operations for servers and clients, and enables different applications to be built. Annotea in Amaya for instance allowed the user to specify the URI of an annotation server. In order to reference target resources, annotations used <cite><a rel='cito:citesAsAuthority' href='https://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-element/' data-versionurl='https://web.archive.org/web/20190709212307/https://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-element/' data-versiondate='2019-07-09T21:23:07Z'>XML Pointer Language</a></cite> (<abbr title='XML Pointer Language'>XPointer</abbr>) to specify the part of HTML or XML-based documents that the annotation was in context of.

                      <p>Amaya and Annotea emerged at a time when publishing and consumption standards on the Open Web Platform were still relatively in the early phases. The most apparent conceptual similarities between the Amaya and Annotea combination with dokieli is that they treat the hosting document as one of the environments to perform read and write operations from.</p>

                      <hr></hr>

                      <p id='dokieli-hypothes.is'>A tentative view of the interoperability between Hypothes.is and dokieli is as follows. The client applications Hypothes.is and dokieli are non-conflicting in that when used in the same content or context, each can still be used on its own. A Hypothes.is client application can search and fetch annotations from an associated server using the Hypothes.is API, and render them on the target resource. dokieli can discover the WA annotation service of a Web resource, fetch annotations from servers conforming to WAP and LDP specifications, and render them on the target resource. Additional data about the annotation can be created and reused in both applications. A Hypothes.is client application can authenticate with a particular server using OAuth. Actors with WebID in dokieli can authenticate with servers supporting WebID-TLS and WebID-OIDC. Both can create annotations given authorization. Hypothes.is application can extend and direct annotations to a community group using the same server. dokieli triggers content negotiation with servers to determine preferred RDF serialization of Web Annotation and profile. The Hypothes.is client can only fetch annotations from a corresponding Hypothes.is server. dokieli can only fetch annotations from servers implementing LDP, WAP or AP. Putting the method of fetching an annotation resource aside, it is possible for either client application to render an annotation serialized as JSON-LD that is created by the other application. The notion of "private" content in Hypothes.is is tied to the annotation server that client application is associated with, whereas "private" content in dokieli is associated to actor\u2019s preferred storage location and access control policies based on individual, class of, or group WebIDs.</p>

                      <p>Existing server and client applications in particular to authoring and publishing are complex systems in that while they adhere or adopt some aspects of open Web specifications, they also include proprietary designs. Such systems also have varying characteristics of centralisation and decentralisation, hence, while some aspects are interoperable, other areas require post facto efforts to interop.</p>

                      <p>The tools which provide good collaborative editing user-interfaces appear to do so at the expense of data ownership and interoperability; those which promote creation and publication of data in open reusable formats are lacking facilities for linking discourse and conversation to concepts published. Decentralised creations also mean that each author can choose their own semantics eg. their own vocabulary to annotate using the RDF language, and then such decentralised documents can link to each other and their schemas can also be mapped to each other, whereas in centralised systems this is (if they support structured semantics at all) often prescribed, either technically enforced, or encouraged by social convention.</p>

For information extraction to take place, the consumer needs to 1) process the HTML, 2) select the <code>script</code> node, 3) parse the content in RDF. On the other hand, RDFa can be included on any HTML tag, and so all human-visible content in HTML can be complemented with machine-readable counterparts in the same context node. This is optimal in avoiding data duplication in the same document which happens to be the case with the other serialisations in RDF, as well as avoiding any further intervention to synchronise data across different nodes.
